		<name>[中文]Deep Dungeon</name>
		<desc>Madō Senki is set in the town of Dorl. One day, monsters raided the town, stealing both the treasures and Princess Etna's soul. Despite the attempts of brave warriors to retrieve her soul, none have been successful.

In the dungeon, the player is given a command list. The player can choose to attack if an enemy is in the vicinity, view allocated items, escape from battle, examine the area for items, and talk if there are people nearby. The character's effectiveness in battle is largely determined by numerical values for attacking power (AP), defensive power (AC), and health (HP). These values are determined by the character's experience level (LEVEL), which raises after the character's accumulated experience (EX) reaches a certain point.</desc>

		<name>[中文]In Your Face City Trains</name>
		<desc>IYFCT is a simple but fun one-button-game similar to Canabalt.

The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can. Jump over trains with closed doors and try (as much as possible) to run through trains with open doors to avoid birds and tunnels. Some open trains will give you coffee. When your coffee-meter is full, you have one extra life.</desc>
