		<sortname>004 =-  Adventures of Willy Beamish, The (USA)</sortname>
		<desc>Willy Beamish is a kid who likes to goof off and have fun. Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that's school's out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.
The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded. 
The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.</desc>

There are four different game modes to choose from: Playoffs, Single Game, Season and another season mode that lets the player act out the 1994 NFL season schedule.  It also had variable weather conditions that the players on the field would react to and a battery back-up to save games.  It also featured Chris Berman, who not only graced the front cover but also gives commentary as well.</desc>

		<desc>Heart of the Alien is a cinematic platformer video game developed by Interplay Entertainment and Virgin Interactive and was released by Virgin Interactive in 1994 for the Sega CD exclusively in North America. It is a sequel to Another World and continues the story directly from where the original ended. The game switches the player's role from Another World; this time the player takes control of Buddy, the main character's alien ally from the previous game.
The story picks up immediately after the end of Another World. Buddy lands the pterodactyl in the ruins of his village, lays Lester down on a cot to rest and walks through the village, thinking of his past. This sequence contains many flashbacks of events that lead up to Buddy's capture and his and Lester's escape from prison. In the game, Buddy is searching for the red-eyed alien responsible for the destruction of his village and the imprisonment of his people. Buddy enters again the prison in search of the red-eyed alien.
Near the end of the game, Lester who wakes back up, helps Buddy out, but then dies in the process. Buddy then goes to find again the red-eyed alien in a fortress. Eventually, he is able to find him and traps him in a cage with a beast that kills him. At the end of the game, Buddy gives Lester's body a ceremonial cremation. It is shown later how Buddy's village is rebuilt with its citizens living again in harmony.</desc>

		<desc>Remember the days as a kid when you were fascinated with these big machines on the building site? With this game you have the opportunity to try them out! You can use either the excavator, bulldozer, steamroller or wrecking ball. The handling couldn't be easier, there are just three buttons to press: left, right and use.
With each machine you get a simple task, e.g. carry three shovels of dirt on a truck. But the fun thing is that you aren't restricted to this and can just screw around. Why wreck an old house when the pit latrine is so much more tempting? The whole game is presented in full motion video - the reactions are very humorous and with a fair share of slapstick. To improve the long time motivation there are even multiple videos for every action, e.g. the first time you break a road block with the the excavator you drive on a highway, the second time into a canyon, the third time onto a rollercoaster and so on...</desc>

You're actually on rails in this game, as you travel in a truck/train called Loadstar along a magnetic rail network covering the moon. Shifting the cursor to the edge of the screen changes to a different track when available, with incorrect turns either killing you instantly or moving you off-course from the level end. Direction indicators and distant landmarks help keep you driving in the right direction, while accidents, track closures, and robot cops work to keep you from it. Your weapons "tag" enemies and force them to explode, or can tag incoming shots and deflect them with a separate shield button.</desc>

A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered "Hollywood", including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest.</desc>

		<desc>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a video game that is based on the 1994 film of the same name. This version includes a bonus game: Bram Stoker's Dracula.
The player controls Frankenstein's monster as he stomps through the streets of Ingolstadt, Bavaria, in the year 1793 seeking revenge against a certain man named Victor for rejecting him once he was created. Since he is a product of artificial manufacturing, he is condemned and declared an expendable pariah by peasants and soldiers. The common folks that strive to kill Frankenstein's monster are highly ignorant about modern science and believe that he is truly a demon.
The player uses a wooden stick to ward off enemies. The stick that Frankenstein's monster carries can be put on fire if swung towards fire. Frankenstein also has an additional attack; a blue ball of negative energy that pops up when the player releases the button. Peasants in the game can either be male or female; soldiers are always male. The female peasants attack with pots while the male peasants attack with melee weapons. However, the soldiers (men dressed in red) attack the player with musket shots. Simple puzzles involving switches and pulleys must be solved in order to progress within the levels.</desc>

		<desc>The Masked Rider is a Japanese super hero, a man who has become genetically altered to be a man/grasshopper who rides a motorcycle.
This FMV game adapts scenes from the movie Masked Rider ZO, and creates a Dragon's Lair style experience. The game centers around 10 battles of the film's 3 main characters.
The player watches the video and hits the correct direction or button at the right time to achieve success. The visual cues of the movie suggest the correct buttons. For example, when the Masked Rider punches, the player should press the Punch button. If he dodges left on screen, the player should press the left direction pad. Correct timing hits the enemy harder, lowering their health bar. Failure reduces the players health.</desc>

		<desc>Virtual Television has given us a chance to do the things that we can't make real in everyday life: Race through 14 great tracks in 5 different environments in a totally virtual place where you can kill each other quite easily with sidekicks or guns. In every track you will see some symbols that can make your car speed up, slow up or even blow up, like your mega-host Lance Boyle says, "Who knows; who cares!" Everything you see in MegaRace is virtual and no one really dies there. So have fun!</desc>

		<desc>A FMV rail shooter placing you in the helmet of rookie chopper gunner "Joker." Terrorists have kidnapped a German biochemist and taken him to a Middle Eastern oil refinery, where he is forced to work on a lethal toxin. Joker and crew must fly to the refinery, shooting down enemy tanks and helicopters, then Joker must rappel down to the refinery and rescue the chemist on foot.
The helicopter sections follow a pattern similar to Tomcat Alley, showing brief clips of the cast in the cockpit, followed by a "nose camera" shot of an enemy approaching. During this shot, you have the ability to move a set of crosshairs over the enemy and press the "fire" button. If you're on target, you are rewarded with military archival footage of helicopters shooting rockets, and close up footage of models exploding. 
The on-foot sections follow an identical pattern, though with hand-held cameras placing you in the "eyes" of Joker, and black-clad guards taking the place of helicopters. Otherwise, the idea of having a few seconds to react and aim crosshairs is the same. The plot is expanded through occasional cutscenes in both the helicopter and foot sections.</desc>

		<desc>Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors is an unreleased video game endorsed by magicians Penn Jillette and Teller. It was planned to be released for the Sega Mega-CD in April 1995, with PC and 3DO versions coming out later in the year, but was cancelled as the publisher, Absolute Entertainment went bankrupt.
Frank Cifaldi, editor of Lost Levels brought the game to the public after being handed a copy by a magazine reviewer. It is a compilation of minigames and a platform game starring the two magicians, made to fool your friends.
The game has become famous due to the inclusion of the "Desert Bus" minigame. In Desert Bus, the player drives a bus across the United States, from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada at a real-time maximum speed of 45 miles per hour. This means the journey is eight hours long, and as the game cannot be paused, play is continuous. There is no scenery to speak of and no traffic, and the bus always veers slightly to the right, meaning the player cannot let go of the controller within that time. The journey is also a perfectly straight line, and once you've arrived at Las Vegas, you will score one point and be offered the chance to take the trip back.
The score counter goes up to a maximum of 99, meaning gameplay is 41 days long. This minigame is used annually for the "Desert Bus For Hope" charity event, who have raised $233,678.47 in the last three years by getting people to play Desert Bus for as long as possible. Supposedly the realistic journey time was built in direct response to the video game controversy surrounding many violent games of the time.</desc>

		<desc>The first of Digital Pictures' "Make My Video" line has you "editing" three of C + C Music Factory's most famous songs - "Gonna Make You Sweat," "Things That Make You Go Hmm..." and "Here We Go Let's Rock &amp; Roll."
The plot puts you inside the music factory of the game's name, where two linemen sweat and toil under the oppressive thumb of a wheelchair-bound corporate executive. Video discs literally roll down an assembly line while C + C record their sounds behind three closed doors. You are asked to help out in editing these videos, appease the corporate masters, and lift the burden from everyone.
The game is played from a panel meant to resemble and act as a non-linear editor. Editing is entirely linear however, as three distinct video "feeds" run simultaneously along the bottom of the screen. Each is mapped to the A, B, or C button, and pressing one sends that video to master viewer, where it is recorded. The D-pad toggles various effects on and off from a bin in the upper left. One feed will always be of C + C's actual video, with the other two holding appropriate stock footage (like a doorbell timed to appear with the lyrics "Ding dong, who is it?")
The video can not be stopped or rewound once the editing process begins, so the player must quickly route video to the viewer and apply effects within a given amount of time. This allows for editing challenges, where the player must fill specific requests, like having fast cuts or showing no dancers.
After a video is edited, the player gets to watch their cut in its entirety. They are then graded by the FMV characters and move to the next song, or try a new edit of the previous one.</desc>

Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.</desc>

		<desc>Sewer Shark is an FMV-based shooter, and one of the first games released for the Sega CD.  You move a crosshair around the screen and shoot targets.  Occasionally, you can also choose to change directions at fixed points.
Of course the real attraction in a game like this is the story.  In the future, maybe in the year 2000, people will be forced to move underground and live in tunnels.  Unfortunately, these tunnels are infested with mutated rat / alligator creatures known as "ratigators."  You are pilot of a Sewer Shark, a craft designed to navigate the Sewers and rid them of ratigators.  It's a dangerous job, but if you clear out enough vermin you can win a one-way trip to Solar City and sunny beaches.</desc>

		<desc>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective is a full motion video video game based on a tabletop game-gamebook hybrid which had the same name. The game uses live actors and sets as the player controls Sherlock Holmes and his longtime partner Dr. Watson, trying to solve three separate crimes by visiting various locations, listening to the dialogue, reading the included mock London newspapers, and, when the player gets enough evidence, answering the judge's questions.
At the beginning of each case a full motion video clip depicts Holmes and Watson meeting a client and learning a few background clues about the case. Then the player must visit a particular location or person, read the London newspapers for clues or ask one of the young Baker Street Irregulars to investigate. The object of each case is to gather enough clues in the shortest time possible, then go before a judge who will then ask the player to answer the important questions about the case. If the player is successful, a full motion video clip will take the player back to Holmes' and Watson's study where they will review the events that transpired, and Dr. Watson will inform the player of his or her score, based on the length of time it took to solve the case.</desc>

		<desc>Slam City with Scottie Pippen is a Full-Motion-Video basketball game. It uses proprietary technology to allow switching from one scene to another without lag, which allows for smoother interactive video.
Gameplay is relatively simple, using little more than arrow keys, and is very different from any other basketball simulation. Basketball is merely the subject for the game's plot, involving the new-guy, Ace (the player), and a host of other characters, basketball players or just spectators, all with different personalities. It's basically play one-on-one on a warehouse court and climb the "ladders" until you earn enough respect to play against Scottie Pippen.
The game features a total of 13 characters, 5 of which the player has an option to play against, all of which are played by real actors.</desc>

In the Classic Game, up to 6 players roll an on-screen die and move their 'pie-dish' marker around the spoke-and-wheel game board, just like the board game. The square you land on is color coded to one of six trivia categories: People &amp; Places, Sports &amp; Leisure, History, Arts &amp; Entertainment, Science &amp; Nature, and Wild Card. Answering the trivia question correctly lets you take another turn.
Further, if you are on the 'prize' square at the end of each spoke (1 spoke end for each category color), the correct answer grants you a colored pie piece in your pie-dish marker for that category. Once you have all 6 pie pieces in your dish, you need to head back to the hub for a final random question to win the game.</desc>

		<desc>Slam City with Scottie Pippen is a Full-Motion-Video basketball game. It uses proprietary technology to allow switching from one scene to another without lag, which allows for smoother interactive video.
Gameplay is relatively simple, using little more than arrow keys, and is very different from any other basketball simulation. Basketball is merely the subject for the game's plot, involving the new-guy, Ace (the player), and a host of other characters, basketball players or just spectators, all with different personalities. It's basically play one-on-one on a warehouse court and climb the "ladders" until you earn enough respect to play against Scottie Pippen.
The game features a total of 13 characters, 5 of which the player has an option to play against, all of which are played by real actors.</desc>

		<desc>Super Strike Trilogy is an unreleased video game compilation for the Sega Mega-CD.
Super Strike Trilogy was announced at E3 1995 and was meant to include enhanced editions of Electronic Arts' first three Strike games, Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and Urban Strike, potentially with extra content removed from their original cartridge releases due to space contraints. The disc was however cancelled for unknown reasons.
A prototype featuring the complete version of the game was dumped and released on the internet in July 2017.
Strike is a series of video games created by Mike Posehn, John Patrick Manley and Tony Barnes released between 1991 and 1997 by Electronic Arts for a number of video game systems. The games are multi-directional shooters viewed from an overhead or top-down perspective. The first three games in the series were 2D and used isometric sprites to give the illusion of 3D depth since real-time 3D polygon rendering wasn't possible at the time</desc>

		<desc>In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates).  You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies.  It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.
The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.
You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</desc>

A Sega CD exclusive, the title is actually a port of SEGA's arcade fight-sim Strike Fighter, a Japan-only arcade release that attempted to mix the sim "lite" gameplay of G-Loc Air Battle with After Burner's arcade gimmicks. As such, the game features the ability to play both in the cockpit as well as in the classic third person perspective. Both night and day scenarios are now available, with mission objectives that include new air-ground strikes. 
Includes 3 gameplay modes: Arcade, Timed and "Hits" which measures how many enemies you can shoot down in specific waves. No multiplayer support available.</desc>

Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.
The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.
When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.
The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).
Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.</desc>

		<desc>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.
This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Iron Helix (USA)</name>
		<desc>A rogue navy ship, Jeremiah Obrian, threatens to start a war. A virus has wiped out its crew, but the threat of it firing its Iron Helix doomsday weapon is still there. You must remotely pilot an unarmed science robot to explore the ship and work out how to shut the weapon down.
The game uses interactive quarter-screen footage to display the ship's interiors. The main challenge is that an automated security device is chasing you down, and must be avoided and ultimately destroyed. A delay between your commands and the robot's receipt of them forces you to pay close attention to the security drone and plan several steps ahead.
As you explore the ship, you will find data ports, which can be jacked into to gain information or to open doorways. To access most of these, you will need to find and collect a DNA sample from a member of staff whose role gave him/her access.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Jaguar XJ220 (USA)</name>
		<desc>In the early nineties, the Jaguar XJ220 was the fastest serial-produced car ever. Core Design acquired the right to build a game around it, in a move to counter Gremlin's immensely successful Lotus series.
Just like Lotus, Jaguar XJ200 is a view from behind racer. There are 32 tracks all over the world, with varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix, with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers. Between races, you must mend the damage your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money. Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.
The game can also be played in a two-player split-screen mode and features a track editor for when you tire of the built-in courses.</desc>

The story takes place after the events of the movie/book. You are sent back to Jurassic Park to retrieve dinosaur eggs from around the park and put them in an incubator. You only have 12 hours to retrieve one egg from every species of dino in the park. Unfortunately, shortly before arriving at the park, your helicopter crashes!</desc>

		<path>./Lawnmower Man, The (USA).chd</path>
		<name>[中文]Lawnmower Man, The (USA)</name>
		<desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. 
With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.
While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 
The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

		<desc>In the once peaceful land of Mistral, legend holds of a brave knight named Drak who has sealed an evil god named Deoric beneath the six continents of the land. However, peace never lasts. The Garuda Empire has invaded the lands of Mistral, and the six Dark Generals, led by Sornbul, have conquered the continents. Sornbul's ambition is nothing less than to resurrect Deoric and plunge the land into chaos.
Duran, descendant of Drak, is the only one who can stop the Garuda Empire's mad plan, and with the power of Drak's mystic armors, he heads off to stop Sornbul at any cost.
The six continents of Mistral can be challenged in any order, each of which are filled with hordes of demons and one of Sornbul's Dark Generals. After completing all six continents the player will face Sornbul on the final island. Before a level the player can choose from one of four elemental armors, each with its own bullet spread and unique bomb. The armor's attack can be powered up several levels by finding jewels dropped by enemies. This power level, as well as the armor's health, is reduced when hit. Enemies also drop crystals that are used in a between-level shop to buy additional health, bombs, and continues.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2051, two mega corporations battle it out for supremacy over an overcrowded, overpolluted planet.  CyberTech Industries, the dominant company on the planet, is being challenged by Axiom, who blames the former for their president's death.  To gain revenge, they secretly inject CyberTech's president, Anton Korsby, with a virus that threatens to take over his body, and ultimately destroy himself and CyberTech. Your mission is to enter Korsby's body, destroy the virus, and defeat the organism that controls his brain.
Microcosm is a 3D action shooter, similar to Descent, that takes place entirely within the human body. The concept was inspired by the 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage. The player pilots his way through various parts of the anatomy, blasting virii and enemy ships, while gaining power-ups and faster, stronger craft. The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby's body.
Microcosm makes heavy use of full-motion video and features high-resolution fractal graphics (to simulate the walls of veins and arteries), digital music and sound effects.</desc>

		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.
Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.
Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</desc>

		<name>[中文]NHL '94 (USA)</name>
		<desc>After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in NHL '94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in the series.
Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides).</desc>

		<name>[中文]Popful Mail (USA)</name>
		<desc>In this platform action game, you play as a cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail. While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet.  One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.
Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game.
This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the  earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Powermonger takes the basic design and concepts of Bullfrog's previous game Populous, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.
The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game.  Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.</desc>

		<desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!
Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.
The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

		<desc>Prize Fighter is a FMV boxing game which puts the player in the body  of "The Kid" against four opponents: Honeyboy Fernandez, Mega Joe Falco, Rex Hawkins, and the ultimate challenge, Nuke "The Duke" Johnson, divided over two CDs.
While the game requires a completely different approach than sprite or polygonal games, the tactics are still the same - jab, punch and deliver uppercuts when the opponent has his defenses down, and block and bob as he makes his moves. After a win the player can improve his left and right glove abilities and stamina by assigning "Power Points" to each area.
The only sprites visible during the bouts are the player gloves and the health indicators - the boxers and the rest of the ring are black and white FMV. Like with other FMV games, the player can enable  tips, which indicates to hit certain butttons when required.</desc>

		<desc>The story takes place in Japan, you play as Hayate, a young up and coming ninja warrior out to stop the evil of Lougi and his army of ghouls and goblins. You are out to avenge your father's death as well as the emperor and rescue your girlfriend from the clutches of evil and bring an end to the terror visited upon your lands.
Some of the villians you face are Marco Killmore (a half man, half eagle samurai warrior), Zallen (a disgraced samurai warrior out to destroy Hayate), Vengor (a stone shiva-type character), Desfal (a medusa-like woman), Destroyer MPK (a possessed collection of samurai armor) and of course the evil samurai knight himself, Lougi.
To play the game you must press the corresponding buttons on the screen at a certain time, such as pressing left to go left or possibly to avoid a enemies weapon or pressing one of the regular buttons to draw your weapon and attack a certain enemy, much like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. There are three difficulty levels, each one giving you a certain amount of time to press the buttons, the hardest setting giving you the least amount of time.</desc>

		<desc>Road Avenger dates from the era when interactive movies (e.g. Dragon's Lair, Escape from Cybercity, Time Gal...) with film-quality graphics, but limited player movement, were highly popular.
Players assume the role of an angry cop on a wild ride as he pursues a gang of bikers who killed his wife. Players need to race through oncoming traffic, squeeze between trucks, trash motorcycles and steer through lots of explosions. The only thing needed are quick reflexes to follow the instructions on the screen (with an increasing difficulty) in order to keep the animation going.
The action is shown from a first-person view and fast-paced, while still maintaining smooth and detailed anime drawn graphics.</desc>

		<path>./Road Rash (USA).chd</path>
		<name>[中文]Road Rash (USA)</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. 
There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.
There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.
If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.
The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</desc>

		<desc>Deep in the Caribbean lies Melee Island, ruled by the beautiful governor Elaine Marley. The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death! As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. You are Guybrush Threepwood, a young man whose only wish is to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar you meet three pirates who tell you'll have to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. Could Guybrush ever suspect that while trying to complete those tasks, he will encounter the governor Elaine Marley, fall in love with her, and face the anger of the dreadful ghost pirate LeChuck?! This is when Guybrush' adventure truly begins!
The Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in  Maniac Mansion: you construct commands for Guybrush by clicking on the appropriate verb, and then clicking on the inventory item or an object in the room you want to interact with. It is the first LucasArts' adventure game in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or to die. The branching dialogue system, where you choose one of the available responses while talking to people, allows you to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice. There are plenty of inventory-based puzzles to solve, and even "insult swordfighting" to participate in, where Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword!</desc>

		<name>[中文]Silpheed (USA)</name>
		<desc>Silpheed for the Sega CD is a shoot-'em-up sequel to the PC title of the same name. Gameplay is similar: this is basically a 2D shooter with 3D graphics.  You move your ship in a 2D plane that reaches into the screen, kind of like a pinball table. The Sega CD version of Silpheed uses pre-rendered video for the backdrops, and filled polygon graphics for the player ship and enemies. 
The story here is typical for a game of this type. The central computer system controlling the galaxy network has been hacked by terrorists.  The terrorists are using the computer to attack colony planets throughout the system.  You are the Galaxy Union's last resort: you must fight your way across 11 stages to reach Earth, and re-take control of the computer.</desc>

		<desc>Similar to adaptations of The Terminator on other systems, the Sega CD game is a platformer where the player controls Kyle Reese, who travels back in time from the year 2029 to protect Sarah Connor from the unstoppable killing machine known as the Terminator.
The game consists of 10 levels. Future locations include the post-apocalyptic wasteland of 2029 Los Angeles and the time displacement complex. In the present of 1984, Reese must traverse the streets and rooftops of L.A., as well as the Tech Noir club, the police station, and, for the finale, an automated factory. 
Reese is armed with a gun with unlimited ammo as well as a limited number of grenades to dispatch the many enemies, including Terminators and HKs in the future and punks in the present. In addition to these, several bosses must also be fought. The boss battles include several encounters with the Terminator, who naturally cannot be completely destroyed until the finale, but must be driven back to keep him from harming Sarah.
Between levels, the game shows small digitized clips from the film that advance the storyline. The game also features a fully CD-based soundtrack with tracks ranging from heavy rock to electronic tunes.</desc>

		<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.
Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.
You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.
It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

On what is to be the day of their wedding, Castle Lorath is assaulted by the Danek, who have been able to partially reconstruct alien mecha technology from a millennium ago. The castle defenses are powerless against the giant robots, and the king and queen are killed in the attack. The invaders steal Elin in the midst of her wedding vows. Prince Sandor, now the king of the realm, sets out to rescue his betrothed, and find a way to defeat the fearsome alien technology.
The game is a thoroughly "old-school" Japanese-style RPG, meaning that the focus of the game is on fighting random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining experience and gold in process, without any additional gimmicks. The characters come with pre-set "classes" (wizard, bard, etc.), and learn their own abilities/magic spells automatically as they level up.</desc>

Due to an assortment of rare events, the spirits of the Totem have been freed and they have created a bizarre parallel universe that can devour the world. Lowman, the "head" of the Totem, needs some "muscle" as he calls it, to bring them back. He finds a pencil on the desk and makes it come to life. The pencil tells Lowman to call him Woody, WILLLLLLLLD Woody. Lowman explains what has happened with his Totem brothers and now Woody goes into the parallel universe, dimension by dimension, and rounds up Lowman's Totem brothers.
In this game, you destroy your enemies by jumping on top of them and Woody can also wipe them out with his eraser. You can erase certain walls to get through them and you can also erase boxes that most of the time teleport if you press down. Other boxes contain items. You also can sketch things and they will come to life, but you can only do this twice because Woody shrinks very quickly from doing this. There are also power-ups that make you grow again.</desc>

		<desc>Dr. Kal Morrow, expert in genetic research and creation of human-animal hybrids, has been kidnapped and his family brutally murdered by the terrorist organization CHIMERA. His surviving son Saul takes it upon himself to avenge his family. Using his father's research, he turns into a man-wolf and sets out to find CHIMERA's base and defeat their leader Karl Draxx.
As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.</desc>

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>

As players move from room to room, they have to locate victims and neutralize fire hazards.</desc>

		<desc>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.
Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

		<desc>Flashback, known in the US as Flashback: The Quest for Identity, is arguably Delphine Software's greatest work. CD-based versions tend to include full motion video cutscenes and an enhanced music soundtrack, but are essentially the same game. 
The year is 2142. You play as Conrad B. Hart, a man who has lost his memory. After barely escaping from hostile aliens, Conrad's bike crashes on an unknown planet. Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from now on his quest for survival.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Flink (USA)</name>
		<desc>The Misadventures of Flink is a Jump'n Run set in the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.
Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. 
Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</desc>
