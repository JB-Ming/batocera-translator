		<desc>Alfred the chicken must rescue his friends and his bird (pardon the pun) Floella from the Meka Chickens. The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Another Bible</name>
		<desc>Once upon a time, there was a huge war between the humans and the demons. After prolonged battles, both sides came to an agreement and established peace. But now, things start changing. A demon cult is becoming popular, and demons no longer wish to live in peace with the humans. Only you, the Hero of the game (nameless), aided by the Heroine (also nameless) and other friends, is able to bring peace back to the planet.

The Heroine has a special ability: she can talk to the demons you meet in random battles and persuade them to join your party. You can store those demons, collect them, and summon them in battles. Demons are divided into various races and species. Otherwise, the game uses a standard turn-based combat with physical attacks and magic spells.

The game is a part of Megaten universe, but unlike most other Megaten games (with the exception of  Last Bible series), it is set in a medieval world.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Astérix &amp; Obélix</name>
		<desc>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it's later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version.

To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.

There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</desc>

		<desc>The huge Monster Tower stands near the village Monsbaiya. It is populated by vicious monsters, and few dare enter it. But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower.

You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in this unusual "monster-taming" RPG. You must capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you assign different commands to them. Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Battle Arena Toshinden</name>
		<desc>In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3D movement, Toshinden's game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.

Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.

The U.S and E.U PlayStation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. 

The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. 

Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.

The later DOS version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese PlayStation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on PlayStation.</desc>

As you can see, the game takes place with you controlling the paddle at the bottom. Using this, you are intended to deflect the white ball that will fly around. In doing so, you will prevent it from going off-screen - which will induce a loss of life - and also force it to hit the blocks at the top of the screen. By busting blocks, you will complete levels and earn points. Some special blocks have certain functions to them, such as the lettered ones which drop power-ups.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Brain Drain</name>
		<desc>Brain Drain is a puzzle game in which the player has to recreate a pattern, consisting of different symbols like apples or hearts, which is shown in the corner of the screen. The main playing field consists of said symbols, but randomly switched around. The player controls a frame which encloses four of the symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit.

In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by "?" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied automatically. Besides the regular playing mode, there is also the "Brain Race" available which involves solving a certain number of levels (depending on the difficulty) as fast as possible.</desc>

		<path>./Castlevania Legends (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>[中文]Castlevania Legends</name>
		<desc>Take a journey to the very beginning, when Dracula first rose up to terrorize the good people of Transylvania. None dared challenge him, and the people of the country lived in fear and terror - until a young girl rose up and decided to take matters into her own hands. That young girl was Sonia Belmont, the first in the line of the legendary Belmont clan.

While Castlevania Legends plays similar to the earlier Castlevania titles (the protagonist is only armed with a whip and needs to fight her way through five stages plus a hidden stage), there are also some unique features. While it is impossible to roam the stages freely, quite often the player can choose to go one way or another and in doing so skip some areas or find valuable items, collecting all of which will unlock the best ending. Sonia also possesses special power called Burning mode: once in a level (and once per life) she can boost her speed and attack power and become invincible for a short period of time. 

Each of the game's bosses leaves behind an orb with a Soul weapon inside. Sonia can collect five of these weapons: Wind, Ice, Flame, Saint and Magic. Similar to previous games these are activated by pressing up+attack, and require a certain number of hearts. The player can switch to any Soul Power at any moment at a weapon select screen. Sonia's whip can be upgraded three times, the third upgrade adding a fireball-like projectile.</desc>

		<desc>The huge Monster Tower stands near the village Monsbaiya. It is populated by vicious monsters, and few dare enter it. But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower.

You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in this unusual "monster-taming" RPG. You must capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you assign different commands to them. Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</desc>

The first installment in the Dragon Warrior series throws you into the fray with little more than a horned helmet, the clothes on your back and the generosity of Alefgard's citizens. As you move from town to town, fighting monsters and collecting gold, the details of your mission to defeat the Dragonlord will begin to unfold.

Dragon Warrior II
The second quest takes place many years after the defeat of the Dragonlord. An era of peace and tranquility has been broken by the monstrous armies of Hargon, who invade Moonbrook Castel to assassinate the King. As the Prince of Lorasia, you'll need to travel the countryside in search of like-minded adventurers then set off as a party to stop Hargon from resurrecting an evil entity.</desc>

		<desc>The Game &amp; Watch Gallery is Nintendo's first portable compilation featuring their popular line of original 1980's handheld games, featuring the popular "Mr. Game &amp; Watch" himself, as well as Mario and friends.

The compilation consists of four popular titles from the Game &amp; Watch Series, each with a "Classic" and "Modern" version of each game:

1. Octopus: Collects as much treasure as your bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus tentacles that continually swing around you.  In the "Modern" version, Mario becomes the diver, and as he collects more treasure, his bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return to the surface.  Mario can also delay the octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them.

Fire: Position your net to catch the falling people jumping from the burning building.  The "Modern" version has Mario and Luigi rescuing Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess Peach's Castle.  Each falling character has different weights and falling patterns.

Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep the continually walking people from falling through the manholes and into the sewers.  In the "Modern" version, Yoshi must use his tongue to keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling thought the hole, each character having different speeds and patterns.

Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin everything.  The "Modern" version has Bowser dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa King gets the best of Mario.

Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two difficulties: Easy and Hard.  The higher score a player gets in each version, new unlockable bonuses will become available via the "Gallery Corner".  These bonuses include release dates, pictures and animations which tell in greater detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi's portable creations.</desc>

Conker travels through many levels, trying to find presents that the Evil Acorn has stolen. Conker is equipped with a slingshot to battle enemies, such as mutant plants, snakes, and others. Players encounter a few minigames on their adventure, including olympic-type games. If a player started on Game Boy, they had to play through the game before they could play on Game Boy Color.

		<desc>The series follows the adventures of a five-year-old boy named Shinnosuke Nohara (nicknamed Shin-chan) and his family, neighbors, friends and relatives in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan. Shinnosuke's family was initially composed of four members, including Shinnosuke, Misae Nohara (the mother), Hiroshi Nohara (the father) and Shiro (the dog). Family members reach five when the last one arrives, Shinnosuke's little sister, Himawari Nohara. Also on the family side, his angry and often authoritarian grandfather Yoshiji is the opposite of his other grandfather, Ginnosuké, nicknamed "Ginny", who is joking and also perverse. Shinnosuke hangs out most of the time with four of his friends: Nene, Kazama, Masao and Bo. He goes to nursery school where he attends teachers such as Mademoiselle Yoshinaga and Mademoiselle Matsuzaka as well as the principal of the school, Mr. Takakura, whom he and his friends nickname "The godfather" because of his dress and his mafia appearance. Shin-chan is secretly in love with his former teacher, Nanako Ōhara, and also a fan of two superheroes he particularly appreciates, Action Kamen and Cuntom Robo.</desc>

		<desc>DK and Diddy Kong have left in search of The Lost World after hearing of a contest to find it on the radio.  This leaves Dixie stuck with minding her baby cousin Kiddy Kong.  Frustrated at this, she decides to take Kiddy with her and find The Lost World before everyone else!

As with Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes the lead in the third chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can glide using her hair, and carries barrels over her head.  Her partner is the heavy Kiddy, who carries barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit further by somersaulting over platform edges first.

There are also special animal friends that can help the two primates out.  Ellie the Elephant can shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the Swordfish can glide through water with ease. Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as use it to create new platforms.

Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked well away in the levels.  While it's possible to gain an ending without these, to complete the game properly, players must seek them all out and unlock levels of the fabled 'Lost World'.  A new feature to the game series is a Time Attack mode - once players finish the game, they can attempt to beat the best time for certain levels.</desc>

There is also a two-player mode that allows friends to compete head-to-head.

The main gameplay is the same as others with an overhead view with a third-person perspective for penalty kicks. The rules and regulations are up to date and can actually be changed to suit the players style of choice. They can also choose weather conditions, skills of goalies or even the choice to play either indoors or outdoors.

FIFA 2000 is a fully-licensed soccer game that has more than 60 teams from around the world with updated rosters appropriate to the 2000 season. You can choose to play one of five different gameplay modes. Exhibition mode is a quick game where you set the teams and the rules then hit the field. In Tournament mode, you'll square off against an assortment of other teams to see who can take home the final victory. Playoff mode has you playing the final teeth-to-the-grindstone matches where every victory counts. In League mode, you'll play through a full season that culminates in the playoffs to see who is the greatest. Finally, Indoor mode takes the game inside and changes up the rules a little bit, resulting in a fast-paced version of the original. Options available for every mode include weather settings, foul settings, wind, and more. You can also use the password to save all of your stats in League and Tournament modes.</desc>

		<name>[中文]FIFA International Soccer</name>
		<desc>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.

British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases. The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Game &amp; Watch Gallery</name>
		<desc>The Game &amp; Watch Gallery is Nintendo's first portable compilation featuring their popular line of original 1980's handheld games, featuring the popular "Mr. Game &amp; Watch" himself, as well as Mario and friends.

The compilation consists of four popular titles from the Game &amp; Watch Series, each with a "Classic" and "Modern" version of each game:

1. Octopus: Collects as much treasure as your bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus tentacles that continually swing around you.  In the "Modern" version, Mario becomes the diver, and as he collects more treasure, his bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return to the surface.  Mario can also delay the octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them.

Fire: Position your net to catch the falling people jumping from the burning building.  The "Modern" version has Mario and Luigi rescuing Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess Peach's Castle.  Each falling character has different weights and falling patterns.

Manhole: The player must cover the holes to keep the continually walking people from falling through the manholes and into the sewers.  In the "Modern" version, Yoshi must use his tongue to keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling thought the hole, each character having different speeds and patterns.

Oil Panic: The player must collect the dripping blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin everything.  The "Modern" version has Bowser dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa King gets the best of Mario.

Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two difficulties: Easy and Hard.  The higher score a player gets in each version, new unlockable bonuses will become available via the "Gallery Corner".  These bonuses include release dates, pictures and animations which tell in greater detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi's portable creations.</desc>

		<desc>Game Boy Wars Turbo is an enhanced version of the original Game Boy Wars that was released on June 24, 1997. The main new feature in Game Boy Wars Turbo is that the CPU now has a better decision-making algorithm during its turns, allowing battles to proceed swifter than in the original. Turbo also features 50 new maps, as well as Super Game Boy support.

An alternate version of Game Boy Wars Turbo was released as a promotional giveaway by Weekly Famitsu featuring a set of maps submitted by readers of the magazine.</desc>

		<desc>The game is essentially a turn-based battler, in a similar vein to the Pokemon games for the same console. Its battle system is similar to that of an RPG game, but other than that, the similarities end there.

Most of the attacks rely on Button Combos, but the game provides a list of combos for the more inexperienced player.

Gamera's enemies are Gyaos, Guiron and Viras. Eventually, the game's final battle pits Gamera against a clone of himself.

The game's language is in Japanese, but an English fan translation does exist.</desc>

		<desc>Ackman is not what one would call a good person. His job is to murder and steal souls for the Demon Lord. The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.

Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Harvest Moon GB</name>
		<desc>Harvest Moon is a farming simulation where you must build and maintain a farm during the course of a year, while taking care of your budget and yourself. 

You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town's people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend's Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well.

The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work.

From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.

The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Hexcite : The Shapes of Victory</name>
		<desc>Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.

Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)

In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Hugo</name>
		<desc>Hugo: Äventyret går vidare features the Danish TV-troll Hugo, having to save his family by from an evil witch, by avoiding traps in four arcade mini-games. This is the second release in a series of mini-games, based on the TV-show, here loosely strung together to make a package. The same four games were later re-released as Hugo Classic 4.

The four minigames in this package are:Snowboard: A winter game. Hugo climbs a mountain when the witch blows up a bomb causing an avalanche. Hugo rides a snowboard downhill, avoiding large snowballs and evil snowmen blocking his way. There is also path choices to make, by looking at a map, to avoid being caught by the avalanche.

Nimbus: here Hugo rides around a mountain on a Danish vintage motorcycle brand called 'Nimbus', with the goal being the witches cave, and a treasure chest there. On the mountain path he has to avoid rocks falling from above, goats trying to push him off the path, and at the same time pick up fuel canisters and bags of coins. Again, there is a map to follow, as the path branches off along the way to other more dangerous caves.

Underjorden: Hugo explores an underground labyrinth of tunnels, slowly filling with rising water. A map is essential to find elevators and climbing ropes; in the tunnels are monsters such as dragons and jumping skulls to avoid.

Ballong: Hugo has to fly in a leaky balloon, following a map to his final goal, landing in a cave without touching the walls.Provided the player clears/avoids all obstacles, there is a short movie sequence after each mini-game showing the main story of Hugo's adventures unfolding. The game keeps a hi-score list for all games and players, shown after some idle time waiting in the main menu. There are two modes of playing difficulty, an easier TV-mode, and a more difficult Arcade mode, each of which has its own hi-score list.</desc>

This makes sense when you realize that it was adapted by the video game company Titus, who are also French.</desc>

		<name>[中文]International Superstar Soccer</name>
		<desc>International Superstar Soccer is a game for one or two players, or up to four players with multitap. It is by the same team who did the N64 games.

The six main game modes are represented on the main menu by pentagonal facets on a stylised football, they are:
Open Play: Here the player can select any of the A Teams (22 players) or Under 23 teams (18 players) and play a single match in a stadium of their choosing. These matches can be player vs player, player vs cpu or cpu vs cpu. For each team the game's difficulty, and the motivation of the team, goalkeeper etc can be customised
World League: Again using any of the A teams or Under 19 teams the player takes part in a round robin league to become world champion. The league can have as few as four or as many as thirty two teams in it, and the tournament can be a single match or a two match round robin affair. 
The International Cup: This is played between sixty four A teams which are divided into sixteen groups of four for the preliminary round. The top thirty two teams then take part in the Group League with the top sixteen taking part in the Final Tournament
The Under 23 International Cup: This is played between thirty two teams which are divided into eight groups of four for the preliminary round. 
P.K.: This is a penalty kick shootout competition 
Scenario Mode: Ten situations most of which involve trying to win a match, or avoid losing, in the last few minutes of the game. each can be played with up to five difficulty settings
Under 23 League: 


Players can train and edit their teams, change the formations and tactics before the match. During the match they can adjust camera angles, make substitutions and tactical changes, adjust the game speed and so on. The main game element though is controlling the players, making searching passes and scoring goals.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Killer Instinct</name>
		<desc>In the distant future, a monopolistic and technological corporation called Ultratech organizes a fighting tournament known as "Killer Instinct". Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech's experimental warriors.  To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  

Killer Instinct is a 2D versus fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose from ten characters: Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and Thunder. The game is known for its heavy combo-based fighting system, allowing players to pull off moves that land a high number of hits on their opponent, the highest being the "Ultra Combo". The game also features combo breakers, finishing moves and stage fatalities, double energy bars, and a dance-music inspired techno soundtrack.</desc>

Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again...

The King of Fighters '95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi's rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of The King of Fighters '95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the "team edit" concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the "team edit" feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.</desc>

The evil Dark Matter has him under his control and plans to turn Dream Land into a dark world. Kirby's goal is get the fabled rainbow sword and defeat him!

Gameplay consists of a platform game. Kirby is like no other platform character of its time because he can fly with no power-ups, and he can swallow enemies and get their powers. In addition to that, Kirby can now team up with his friends: Rick the hamster, Kine the fish, and Coo the owl. Each team-up has it's advantages and disadvantages, but Kirby can still swallow enemies, making more different powers available depending on the power/friend combination.</desc>

		<path>./Kirby's Star Stacker (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>[中文]Kirby's Star Stacker</name>
		<desc>Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game.  There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:

Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more stars you clear, the higher the score.

Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.

Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row. 

Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.

The game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks.  If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Legend of Zelda : Link's Awakening, The</name>
		<desc>The fourth game in the Zelda series although it does not take place in Hyrule. After being attacked at sea, Link's ship sinks, and he finds himself stranded on Koholint Island. He awakens to see a beautiful woman looking down at him. He soon learns the island has a giant egg on top of a mountain that the Wind Fish inhabits deep inside. Link is told to "awaken the wind fish and all will be answered," so Link sets out on another quest.

Play is similar to the SNES game with a top down perspective. Link must go onto each of the 7 temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, Link must search the land and uncover hidden treasures and items that will allow him to progress on his journey. With new items, he can open up new passages that will take him even farther on his quest and allow him to enter new areas that were inaccessible before. Link can attack his enemies with his sword or use items he finds during his quest to help him. Guarding every instrument is a temple boss, which must be defeated if Link is to awaken the Wind Fish.</desc>

		<desc>The handheld game based on the second Jurassic Park movie puts the player in the shoes of an agent of InGen corporation who is sent to Isla Sorna, also known as "Site B", where dinosaurs still roam freely.

In each of the eight levels, a number of items (dinosaur eggs, computer disks or DNA samples) must be collected to finish the level. Gameplay mostly consists of running, jumping and climbing through the large platform-like levels. However, in the jungles and caves of the island, many enemies await: Both various dinosaur species, including Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptor, and human enemies, employees of InGen's rival BioSyn. The player can defend himself by using kicks and punches, a pistol or a grenade launcher. Ammo and health power-ups can be found in boxes scattered around the levels.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Madden '95</name>
		<desc>The Madden Football series makes its debut on the Game Boy with Madden 95. Unlike most games in the series since 1993, this one does not include a NFL license, and thus features generic team names. The included teams, stats and schedules are however based on the 1994 NFL season.

Standard game modes include exhibition games, full seasons (including playoffs) and playoffs. Special modes include Championship playoffs - featuring 38 legendary champion teams, including Green Bay '66, San Francisco '89 and Pittsburgh '78 - and Franchise playoffs - featuring 12 'all-time' teams. Exhibition mode allows players to select from all regular, champion and franchise teams plus a regular Madden and an all-time Madden team. Game length can be set between 20, 40 and 60 minutes.

The game features a playbook of more than 80 offensive plays (including fake punts and field goals) and more than 60 defensive plays, all of which can be flipped. The game also features freely definable audibles, substitutions (quarterback and halfback only), timeouts, and game stats.

Gameplay during a game is seen from the top, with the field scrolling vertically. Players are moved via the D-pad and the Game Boy's two buttons are used for throwing the ball left or right during passing play, spinning or diving during rushing play, selecting the defender closest to the ball or tackling during defensive play, and so on.</desc>

		<desc>The Madden football series makes its second appearance on the Game Boy with Madden 96. The game is closely based on its immediate predecessor. Like the earlier game, this one is not licensed from the NFL, and features generic team names, but with teams, stats and schedules based on the 1995 NFL season. Both the new expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville as well as rule changes like the two-point conversion are incorporated.

Game modes have been cut down from the predecessor: the only remaining ones are exhibition, season and playoffs. In addition to the 30 regular teams, there is an All-Madden team for use in exhibition games only. Most features from the predecessor make a return: selectable game length (20, 40 or 60 minutes), freely definable audibles, timeouts, and detailed stats. The playbook has been reworked, substitutions are now available for all positions and the game features quarterback speech for the first time.

Game perspective (top-down, vertically scrolling) and controls are mostly unchanged from the predecessor. When played on a Super Game Boy, the game now allows for two players to match up, for which a special bluffing mode is available.</desc>

Like earlier Game Boy titles in the franchise, Madden 97 does not feature an NFL license, so offers only generic team names. Still, teams and stats are based on the 1996 NFL season.

Game modes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Sudden Death. 30 regular teams plus the traditional All-Madden team are available. Besides the usual features like selectable game length, freely definable audibles, flippable playbook, timeouts and substitutions, previously Game Gear-only features making their first appearance on the Game Boy include variable weather and injuries.</desc>

		<desc>Nonograms are number puzzles where logic is used to find the solution. Clues are provided along the sides of the playfield grid, telling the player how many squares to fill in each row and column. With logic the player can figure out exactly which squares of the grid to fill. The thinking process is similar to solving Sudoku puzzles.

Mario's Picross (from PICture CROSSword) is Nintendo's take on Nonograms. In this game, Mario takes on the role of an archaeologist who chisels away the squares in each playfield. The result is a small picture. There are 256 different puzzles to solve, divided into four courses with increasing difficulty level.</desc>

A sudden rampage breaks out, and the cause is found to be a group of robots, led by a mysterious figure. As Dr. Light begins to investigate this rampage and attempts to find a way to stop it, he is kidnapped by the leader of the robots. Rockman hurries to save Dr. Light, but is too late...the only thing he can find at the scene is a yellow scarf...one that almost seems to belong to...Blues!?

Could Rockman's supposed brother, the strange but good-hearted Blues, be the one who kidnapped Dr. Light? Is Blues the one responsible for the rampages? With these questions racing through his mind, Rockman sets off to find Blues and get the answers he wants.

		<desc>Muddy Mole's wife and seven kids have been kidnapped by the evil farmer, Jinbei!  It's up to you to help Muddy solve the many puzzles of Jinbei Land.  Snatch all of Jinbei's cabbages in every level, and if you get stuck, dig underground and create your own secret underground paths.  A word of warning, however - Jinbei has got his best goons guarding your family, so you'd better watch out!

Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective.  Although in each room you have to destroy all the foes to progress, the game is much more puzzle-oriented than it is towards action.  It is quite common in later levels to get yourself 'stuck', which can be fixed by leaving and returning to the screen to reset the puzzle.  One of the game's clever 'hooks' is that players can dig underground in each stage to find a completely different map than they do above ground, which can be used to get through otherwise impassable terrain.

The game also features a two player mode, where one player is Muddy, and the other is Jinbei.  Muddy must swipe as many cabbages as possible, and Jinbei must stop him.  At the end of the round, players swap roles, and then the player who got the most cabbages wins.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Monkey Puncher</name>
		<desc>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. 

Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.

In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. 

During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.</desc>

		<path>./Olympic Summer Games (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>[中文]Olympic Summer Games</name>
		<desc>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.

Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. 

Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.

The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.

Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</desc>

		<path>./Pac-Attack (USA).zip</path>
		<name>[中文]Pac-Attack</name>
		<desc>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.

All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</desc>

		<desc>Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a whole new adventure of our little eater. Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford.

Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries for DOS, Macintosh and Game Boy. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man. However, SNES game, despite using the same basic gameplay mechanics, is an entirely new game using a different game engine and aesthetic.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Pac-Man : Special Color Edition</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<desc>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</desc>

		<path>./Picross 2 (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>[中文]Picross 2</name>
		<desc>Picross 2 is the Japanese only sequel to the Game Boy puzzle game, Mario's Picross.  Your goal is to reveal the hidden picture inside each grid by chipping away the correct squares.  Clues along the grid's edges help you figure out which squares should be chipped away, and which should be left alone.  The puzzles are much more advanced than those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are in a 15x15 grid, while standard Picross puzzles are four 15x15 grids connected together, solved one section at a time.

Picross 2 has two modes of play: the first, Mario's Picross, has you solving Picross puzzles with Mario.  In this mode, the timer ticks down from 30 minutes, and you must solve the puzzle before the timer reaches zero.  If you chip away an incorrect square, you are penalized time (first two minutes, then four, then eight).

After solving a certain amount of puzzles in Mario's Picross mode, you can play Wario's Picross.  In this mode, the timer starts from zero and counts upwards.  You are not penalized time for any mistakes, however, this means that you do not know which squares are correct and which ones are incorrect until the puzzle is complete.</desc>

Like other Bomberman games, Bomberman must defeat all enemies in each stage to advance. The game features a total of 5 worlds spanning 25 levels. Each world follows a different theme, including forest, underwater, cloudtops and a dark underworld. At the end of each world is a boss fight. There is one mini game called Jump Mode in which players must guide Bomberman through an Easy, Medium, or Hard course. Bomberman will constantly jump and the player can only place bombs in this mode.</desc>

		<desc>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters.

This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.

Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Puyo Puyo</name>
		<desc>Puyo Puyo is a falling pieces puzzle, with basic similarities to Tetris. Pairs of puyos (monsters from Compile's RPG series Mad? Monogatari)
fall down from the top into a cylinder. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to get four puyos of the same color touching each other horizontally or vertically. Doing so removes them from the field. Making groups of larger than four, several at the same time or creating chain reactions nets more points. The game ends once the stacked puyos reach the top of the cylinder.

The game offers an endless single-player mode, a two-player mode (first player to fill their cylinder loses) and a mission mode. Mission mode presents the player with a number of pre-filled playing fields with a preset task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all puyos of a certain color.</desc>

Depending on the difficulty setting, the playfield and the number of colors differ (from 5x5 with 3 colors to 20x15 with 4 colors). Once a set is selected, it is removed and the remaining cells are "consolidated" (cells above fall down, cells moving to the left if there is a horizontal space). This also means that possible set get destroyed when the cells are moving.

As soon as the player removes all cells, the game completes. If even only one cell remains, the game is lost.</desc>

		<name>[中文]SeaQuest DSV</name>
		<desc>Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.

Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.

The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right
Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.
Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill
Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport
Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches
Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</desc>

Shaq can jump a huge distance, although he struggles to block.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Small Soldiers</name>
		<desc>Small Soldiers is a third-person action game released at the same time as the movie of the same name. Instead of dealing with the toy Commandos and Gorgonites from the movie, the game uses the characters in an imaginary environment as described on the back of the toy figures' packaging.

It has fourteen levels of single-player action some featuring the Gorgonite Archer, others featuring the commando Chip Hazard. You assume the role of Archer, who has to defend his world against an invasion of the commandos. You can run, jump, climb ledges and fight using a blaster. Many levels involve freeing captured Gorgonites who then help you fight. Multiplayer includes two head-to-head two-player Chip vs. Archer mode where you either need to capture flags or get a set amount of frags.</desc>

		<path>./Space Invaders (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>[中文]Space Invaders</name>
		<desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

The versions on consoles and computers having migrated to 3D graphics, the GBC edition uses traditional sprite-based 2D with a top-down view of the playing field.

Game modes include Exhibition matches, Sudden Death games (first team to score wins), Full Seasons and Playoffs. Progress can be saved through use of passwords. Game features include many known from other iterations of the series, such as player injuries and substitutions, audibles, detailed statistics, control of weather and game time, and more. The playbook not only includes a wide number of standard plays, but also a variety of trick plays like fake field goals and reverse plays.

Team and player names and statistics are from the 1999 NFL season.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Mighty Morphin Power Rangers : The Movie</name>
		<desc>This game is loosely based off of the movie of the same name, where the player can take control of either the Yellow, Black, Pink, Blue, Red or White Ranger in a side-scrolling beat-em-up in an attempt to stop the evil Ivan Ooze who is trying to control the universe.

There are six different levels to play in each with their own standard obstacles and enemies, mid-level bosses and of course end bosses that range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze himself. There are no weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left behind.

Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers. Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter. Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and jumping abilities.</desc>

		<desc>Two fighters enter the arena; the winner will move on in the tournament, the other will be dead. This tournament for control of Earth has been going on for centuries and continues in MORTAL KOMBAT 4. Choose from eight different characters: Fujin, Liu Kang, Sub Zero, Tanya, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reiko, Shinnok, Scorpion, and a few hidden characters as well. Each character has unique moves, combinations, and fatalities, and when you properly execute a fatality, a short animated reenactment plays. Throughout the game, there are special Kombat Kodes that are exclusive to the Game Boy Color, and you'll also get quite a bit of in-game speech. If you think you are the strongest fighter, prove it with MORTAL KOMBAT 4.</desc>

		<desc>Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a whole new adventure of our little eater. Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford.

Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries for DOS, Macintosh and Game Boy. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man. However, SNES game, despite using the same basic gameplay mechanics, is an entirely new game using a different game engine and aesthetic.</desc>

		<path>./Pocahontas (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>[中文]Pocahontas</name>
		<desc>Pocahontas is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Native American Indian later made famous in a Disney movie by the same name. 

The player alternates between Pocahontas and John Smith to complete seven missions. In levels one, two and four, Pocahontas needs to collect feathers for a Shaman woman to receive magic cards, travel through the forest while avoiding the spirit beat, and shake off a boy who chases her to prevent her from reaching the white man's camp respectively.

John Smith is playable in the levels three, five and six. In the third level the American explorer needs to shoot animals running and passing by, on separate planes, by aiming his gun with the mouse. He needs to shoot enough animals to feed his men before it gets dark. The objective is the same in the fifth level, but there he is in a canoe and needs to catch fish. 


In the sixth level he leaps over ravines and across rivers until he meets Pocahontas. Together, they help each other cross a lake. In the final level both characters are controlled as they need to work together to catch a bear.

Next to regular platforming mechanics such as running, climbing, jumping and swinging, there are some minor puzzle elements involving items that are selected from the bottom of the screen. That part also holds a progress bar to show how close the objectives are. Characters are generally controlled with four movement keys. The mouse cursor is visible on the screen and acts as a guide to show the possible actions. Clicking left or right offers different actions.</desc>

		<desc>Seeking revenge on Wario after he stole their treasure in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, special agents from the Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island sneak into Wario's newly built castle, steal back the treasure, and leave the castle and the surrounding area a mess. As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own.

In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</desc>

		<name>[中文]Survival Kids</name>
		<desc>When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship.  With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.

Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link's Awakening.  Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly.  This can be risky, as certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it.

The game also features a unique "merge" system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items.  For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow.  There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it's up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.</desc>

		<desc>An egg arrives from a far-off planet in outer space.  This egg contains a 'Tamagotchi', a baby alien that cannot fend for itself, and requires your attention and care.  Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up.

Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name.  In it, you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room.  From there, you are fully responsible for its care.  Everything from feeding, medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when appropriate - you must do it all.

Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options.  You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously.  The Game Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness.  The three games are:

 Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right.  Try to guess which direction it will face next.
 Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study.  Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them.
 Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit.  Baseballs will rain down from the sky.  Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point.

Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments.  You can enter your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments.  You can increase your chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it could.  Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.</desc>

Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.

The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</desc>

		<desc>Ultraman Ball features the Tsuburaya Productions tokusatsu character Ultraman and his companions. Ultraman is re-imagined as a hero who is able to transform into a ball mode, and uses this new power to save his friends.

In his standard bipedal form, Ultraman is able to cling onto walls and climb up them by repeatedly jumping. As the ball, Ultraman can bowl over enemies and build speed on slopes to help him reach new areas. He can also bounce, which also increases his vertical height. By combining these powers, the player can progress through each stage.</desc>

In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level.

		<name>[中文]World Cup 98</name>
		<desc>The licensed game of the 1998 Football World Cup held in France from June 10 to July 12 and the first World Cup licensed game distributed and developed by Electronic Arts features a tweaked FIFA 98 engine, with all 10 stadiums accurately designed and all 32 teams (plus 8 teams that failed to qualify but still deemed too important to leave out) featuring   real names and close "look-a-like" kits. Changes done to the 3D engine feature include on the fly in-game management with better player positioning AI (including the goalkeeper), and faster gameplay. An editor to change all player information is included, which affects simulated data: the team with higher ratings has a better chance of progressing through the next stage regardless if it is Brazil or China.

It's possible to play with the groups as determined by the real draw,  randomize or customize them to the players' likings, mixing both qualified and additional teams. Once the player wins a trophy, the first of the Classics matches is unlocked. These are eight final matches in the competition's history which are unlocked as the player beats them one by one. Friendlies, training matches and practice penalty shootouts close the modes available.</desc>
