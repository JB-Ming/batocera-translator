		<path>./ChuckieEgg.uze</path>
		<name>[中文]Chuckie Egg</name>
		<desc>Chuckie Egg is a home computer video game port initially released in 1983 for the ZX Spectrum, the BBC Micro and the Dragon. As Hen-House Harry, the player must collect the twelve eggs positioned in each level, before a countdown timer reaches zero. In addition there are piles of seed which may be collected to increase points and stop the countdown timer for a while, but will otherwise be eaten by hens that patrol the level. If the player touches a hen or falls through a gap in the bottom of the level, he loses a life. Each level is made of solid platforms, ladders and occasionally lift platforms that constantly move upwards but upon leaving the top of the screen will reappear at the bottom. Hitting the top of the screen while on one of these lifts, however, will also cause the player to lose a life.</desc>

		<desc>Laser Puzzle is a Uzebox implementation of a laser-based puzzle game. It has 40 levels, and the object is to place pieces on the board in such a way that the laser beam is deflected into one or two targets from the proper direction. Pieces that aren't fixed in place (indicated by a lock icon) may be dragged and dropped onto any blank square, or rotated to face any direction. In order to properly solve each puzzle, the laser beam must pass through all of the pieces that aren't blockers.</desc>

		<desc>Laser Puzzle II is a Uzebox implementation of a laser-based puzzle game. Gameplay is very similar to Laser Puzzle, but there are additional tokens, and some behave differently. Tokens with a padlock overlay cannot be moved or rotated, but tokens with a rotation overlay can be rotated in place, but not moved. The laser itself is a now a token, there are two beam splitters, a double sided mirror, a checkpoint, combination mirror/target tokens, and a cell blocker (which doesn't block the laser). As one might expect, this provides for much more challenging game play!

There are 60 levels, which include beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert challenges. The controls and instructions are included in the game, though I still haven't figured out how to force people to actually read them before playing.</desc>

Gameplay is more or less identical to Bejeweled, or any other match-3 games floating about. The goal is to get at least 3 gems of the same type in a horizontal or vertical row. You do this by swapping two adjacent gems. The only way you can swap a gem is if doing so would line up at least 3 gems of the same type in a row. Getting at least 3 gems in a row clears those gems, and new ones drop down from the top of the board. In both modes, you can get a hint about which gem can be moved to score some points. Note that this is not necessarily the best move possible, it's just *a* move, in case you get stuck.</desc>

		<desc>XOR is a remake of an 8-bit game made by Astral Software back in 1987 for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum etc. The object of the game is to pick up all the masks in the maze. That sounds easy but it can get devilishly difficult on later levels where you have things that can explode and turn the lights on and off. As you complete each level you are given a secret letter - once you have all 15 letters you can discover the hidden word - and become a member of the Order of XOR!</desc>

		<path>./Zooming Secretary (wip).uze</path>
		<name>[中文]Zooming Secretary (wip)</name>
		<desc>Zooming Secretary is an action platform game reminiscent of earlier classic arcade games, with new original concepts. This game is based on the NES port(an original title) by Shiru(programming) and Pinwizz(media). You take the role of an overworked secretary who must answer phone calls before they hang up. Each phone call requires information related to 4 different topics: Earth, History, Literature, and Space. By going to a file cabinet with the specific icon, she will acquire the information related to the topic and can answer any phone call requiring this type information. 
 
The player will need to use quick thinking and cunning to minimize travel time between points and avoid unnecessary trips which may mean answering calls out of order or damage control sacrifices; too many failures and the secretary will be fired(though they have no replacement)! Avoid the boss who slows the secretary down with babble, the unmovable gossiper, the confusing assistant, the wreckless moving man, the creepy secret admirer....all while using healthy dosages of caffeine to speed through the level, and catch her dreamy but elusive "bad boy love interest". After all this, she is really going to need a vacation!</desc>

		<name>[中文]2048</name>
		<desc>2048 is played on a simple gray 4×4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. (source Wikipedia).</desc>
