Each phone call requires information related to 4 different topics: Earth, History, Literature, and Space. By going to a file cabinet with the specific icon, she will acquire the information related to the topic and can answer any phone call requiring this type information. \n \nThe player will need to use quick thinking and cunning to minimize travel time between points and avoid unnecessary trips which may mean answering calls out of order or damage control sacrifices; too many failures and the secretary will be fired(though they have no replacement)! Avoid the boss who slows the secretary down with babble, the unmovable gossiper, the confusing assistant, the wreckless moving man, the creepy secret admirer....all while using healthy dosages of caffeine to speed through the level, and catch her dreamy but elusive \"bad boy love interest\". After all this, she is really going to need a vacation!",
