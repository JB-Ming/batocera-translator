Like the Faceball games on other consoles (like Faceball 2000 on Game Boy and SNES), the Virtual Boy version could be described as an ego shooter with smiley balls. In a maze, which completely misses all unnecessary details and even textures, you have to hunt down and shoot all enemies in a certain time limit, which gets smaller from level to level. A radar in the upper right corner and a map of the maze, which you can be displayed by pressing Start, help you locate your foes. There's a total of 11 enemies called \"Shot Me\", \"Ninja\", \"Death\", \"Stalker\", \"Invisible\", \"Bound\", \"Shieldman\", \"Ghost\", \"Hydra\", \"Wraith\" and \"Berserker\". Each one is acting different, which requires different tactics. For example \"Shieldman\" hides behind an undestroyable shield, while \"Berserker\" runs into the player and knocks you off. You shouldn't let too often, though, because after only one death, the game is over and jumps back to the title screen. So the player should always keep an eye on a little Faceball in the bottom left corner, which tells about the remaining energy by the expression of its face. Bonus items which can be colected are bonus shields and speed-ups. Additionally, there are undestroyable glass wall, through which you can see, but not shoot enemies, which would have been a nice feature in multiplayer games. There are also destroyable walls, which are flashing. \nAfter each level you get points for your remaining time, as well as for the enemies you destroyed, depending on the kind of enemy.",
