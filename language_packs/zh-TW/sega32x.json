It is also reported that Sega of Japan were not keen on use of the \"Virtua\" in the game's name, possibly so that the game was not associated with Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing.

In it, the only selectable character is hamster, Chip, and there is only one empty level (though there are numerous non-moving 3D models of other characters and items dotted around the map).
