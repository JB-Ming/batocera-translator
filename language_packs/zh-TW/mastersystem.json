At the end of each world, there are one of seven bosses waiting to destroy you, but some of the later bosses are exactly the same as the earlier ones. The title is a bit misleading because you can also play as three other characters including Hippo, Leopard, and Monkey Boy. Each character has their own disadvantages. For example, Hippo is much slower than the other three. However, all the characters share one thing in common: they can use their fists and punch enemies as they approach them. They can also jump on them and keep knocking them in the ground until they disappear off the face of the earth. If they don't make them disappear, they will pop back out again and set out for revenge. Obstacles are scattered through each area, including spikes, cannonballs, esculators, fireballs, and steam.\n\nYou start the game with three lives. Once you touch an enemy, you lose a life. Lose any of your lives, and the game is over. If the game is over, you can continue where you left off. There are several items to find, and these can help you on your quest, and one of these items are eggs. If you break any of these eggs, either the \"switch\" item or the invincibility item is revealed. If you're lucky enough, a white bag is also revealed, but more often than not, one of your enemies can pop out from inside the egg. One egg will reveal a bird which you can carry for the rest of the game. This bird may be nothing but a pest, as it hinders your progress, but you can throw it at enemies to knock them out. It can also be used as a backup, meaning that you can have enemies touching you, but it is the bird that is killed, not you.\n\nThere is little chance that you'll find a white bag inside an egg, unless you go up into a secret area, which can often be found if you jump on springs that are scattered throughout the level. These white bags are useless, until you get to the bonus areas, which are at the end of each area. In these bonus stages, you can place a number of foxes on a path depending on how much white bags you've collected throughout each area.\n\nWhen you complete Psycho Fox, you are treated to a funny ending.",

It is a tale of the occult, centred around the buddhist monk Kujaku.\n\nIn this game, Kujaku is sent out by his master, Ajari, to find out what has happened at the nearby temple of Hieizan. Upon arriving, after having fought his way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find his comrades slain. One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his last breath, he utters the word \"Izumo\". Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of Izumo, where he encounters a deadly enemy of unknown origin.\n\nKujakuo is part adventure game à la Déjà vu (or, since this is a Sega game, Hoshi o sagashite), part platform action. To get between the adventure parts, you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight or two, just as in Cosmic Spacehead.\n\nThe adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for descriptions and lines, and a set of verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point out specific objects for your verbs.\n\nIn the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual bolt is small, he can load up before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more powerful magical spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are offensive, but some grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit energy. Enemies will, when killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though.\n\nThis game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.",

There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. \n\n3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).\n\nWhile each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers.

Chapolim is a parody to superheroes in general. He dresses a red grasshopper costume with a yellow heart in the chest with the leters \"CH\". He also usually carries his Marreta Biônica (Chipote Chillón in the original, Squeaky Mallet in English) a red (toy) hammer.\n\nAt each stage, Chapolim must defeat five vampires that are in torpor within their coffins. The coffins are locked, so he must first find the keys to unlock them. He'll find the keys killing the most diverse enemies that haunt the mansion he's in, such as ghosts, bats, fire blowers, mummies, etc. Once he's got a key, he must unlock a coffin and then defeat the vampire who sleeps there.\n\nIn order to kill his enemies, Chapolim can jump over them or punch them. Every once in a while, his Marreta Biônica will come flying from one side of the screen to another, and if he jumps over it, he'll catch it. Chapolim can also punch the lights of the mansion: they'll flash and paralyze his enemies.\n\nChapolim starts with 3 lives and no continues. He'll be healed by collecting treasures through the castle, and will gain additional lives at every 50,000 and 150,000 points.\n\nAll the text in the game is in Portuguese.",

Power-ups like extra life and psycho power can also be collected. If you use the psycho punch or psycho gun, your psycho power gets depleted, and when it is empty, you must stock up on some more. You can also get shields that will protect you from laser beams, and jet engines so that you can fly over hazards.\nIn some areas, you defeat a boss which leaves an ID card, which you can use to access other areas of the fortress. \n\nSome chief cyborgs are easy to kill, while some are hard. You will just have to work out which weapon works best with them. The game ends when you lose all your life. \n\nYou are not alone in this mission. You also have Adina, your contact back at headquarters. Follow her instructions carefully and you may survive.\n\nCyborg Hunter is based on the Japanese-only Borgman.",

At the end of each round, you come face to face with a boss, which takes quite a number of hits to kill with your sword. Once they are defeated, they are likely to give you one of the objects that you need to defeat Gilbas. More to the story is then revealed.\n\nAssisting you with your journey are three animals: an eagle, a monkey, and some other animal that I am unfamiliar with. To get these animals to help you, however, you will need to collect three of their tokens that are found in yellow chests. These animals are quite useful in dangerous situations. The eagle, for example, can get a hold of you and fly you to safety if more than one type of enemy surrounds you.

While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.",

For example, small dots award ten points each, while you get 200 points for each larger dot you collect. Once you have collected all the dots in the maze, the enemies will turn into coins, which you must quickly get in a strict time limit and you move on to the next maze. Just before this, though, you get a statistics screen that shows the amount of time that you spent in the maze. Points are also awarded, but sadly, if you spent over sixty seconds in a maze, you won't get any.\n\nEvery world you travel to consist of three mazes, and after you complete all three, a bonus round appears where the object is to collect all coins before time expires. While you are collecting the dots in the normal mazes, you must touch the enemy's energy, a flashing red spot within each maze to avoid 2nd-generation enemies from entering the mazes. Some power-ups can be collected, which consist of weapons and speed boosters (big wings), which can be collected by landing on the circle which it is in. However, you need money in form of the amount outlined just before each maze. If you land on a circle while you are short of cash, a 'NO SELLING' sign will appear above it, and you have to collect some more dots and try again. \n\nAlso you can die by touching an enemy. When you die, a coin will take you place, and when you get resurrected, you can grab the coin. The game can be played with two players, but the same rule applies in a 2-player game.",

Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms.

It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated \"proton packs\" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurect an evil goddess, Gozer. \n \nGhostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for \"ghost alarms\" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away. \n \nAs the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.",

For instance, \"Arcade\" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas \"Grand Prix\" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. \n\nF1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.",

If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.\n\nMore often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).",

Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.\n\nThe first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.",

Upon arriving, after having fought his way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find his comrades slain. One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his last breath, he utters the word \"Izumo\". Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of Izumo, where he encounters a deadly enemy of unknown origin.\n\nKujakuo is part adventure game à la Déjà vu (or, since this is a Sega game, Hoshi o sagashite), part platform action. To get between the adventure parts, you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight or two, just as in Cosmic Spacehead.\n\nThe adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for descriptions and lines, and a set of verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point out specific objects for your verbs.\n\nIn the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual bolt is small, he can load up before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more powerful magical spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are offensive, but some grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit energy. Enemies will, when killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though.\n\nThis game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.",

The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.\n\nThese levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.\n\nViewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.\n\nThe real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.",

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.\n\nMortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a \"Fatality\" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.\n\nMortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.",

However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. \n\nIn some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up.

There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.",

If they don't make them disappear, they will pop back out again and set out for revenge. Obstacles are scattered through each area, including spikes, cannonballs, esculators, fireballs, and steam.\n\nYou start the game with three lives. Once you touch an enemy, you lose a life. Lose any of your lives, and the game is over. If the game is over, you can continue where you left off. There are several items to find, and these can help you on your quest, and one of these items are eggs. If you break any of these eggs, either the \"switch\" item or the invincibility item is revealed. If you're lucky enough, a white bag is also revealed, but more often than not, one of your enemies can pop out from inside the egg. One egg will reveal a bird which you can carry for the rest of the game. This bird may be nothing but a pest, as it hinders your progress, but you can throw it at enemies to knock them out. It can also be used as a backup, meaning that you can have enemies touching you, but it is the bird that is killed, not you.\n\nThere is little chance that you'll find a white bag inside an egg, unless you go up into a secret area, which can often be found if you jump on springs that are scattered throughout the level. These white bags are useless, until you get to the bonus areas, which are at the end of each area. In these bonus stages, you can place a number of foxes on a path depending on how much white bags you've collected throughout each area.\n\nWhen you complete Psycho Fox, you are treated to a funny ending.",

You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.\n\nThe R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called \"The Force\", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).\n\nThe stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.",

Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.\n\nLike the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation.

He also has to collect enough \"proof\" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob).

In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.\n\nThe ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.\n\nBart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.",

To make things even worse, next night will be a full moon, and if Tia Nastácia doesn't get cured until then, she'll sleep for 100 years! So, Pedrinho (Pete) and Emília (Emily) are sent to bring the ingredients and cure Tia Nastácia.\n\nSítio do Picapau Amarelo (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch in English) is based on the works of Monteiro Lobato, a Brazilian writer. One or two players (in hot-seat mode) can choose to play either the boy Pedrinho (or Pete, in the English version of the books) or the rag doll Emília (Emily in the English version). The items they must gather are based on Brazilian folklore.\n\nGameplay consists in basic side-scrolling/platforming. Either characters can jump (button 2), run (either pressing the D-pad twice to a direction, or holding a button and the D-pad to a direction), shoot (button 1), and duck. The game has four levels (one for each ingredient, the last one with two of them), all set in the ranch, with indoor levels, underwater levels, caves and such.\n\nEach character starts with 3 lives. They have a health bar, which can be replenished by gathering items such as nests with eggs, or by freeing birds from cages. The enemies faced are most animals, such as bats, bugs, spiders, snakes, piranhas, jaguars and monkeys.\n\nAll in game text is in Portuguese.",

There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half.

Upon arriving, after having fought his way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find his comrades slain. One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his last breath, he utters the word \"Izumo\". Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of Izumo, where he encounters a deadly enemy of unknown origin.\n\nKujakuo is part adventure game à la Déjà vu (or, since this is a Sega game, Hoshi o sagashite), part platform action. To get between the adventure parts, you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight or two, just as in Cosmic Spacehead.\n\nThe adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for descriptions and lines, and a set of verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point out specific objects for your verbs.\n\nIn the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual bolt is small, he can load up before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more powerful magical spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are offensive, but some grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit energy. Enemies will, when killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though.\n\nThis game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.",

Some levels feature \"death drops\" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.

In Practice a single player can play any of the 18 holes available. Match Play is 2 player mode against human or computer. Stroke Play is the player can play up to 4 others that can include 1 computer player. In this mode the character skill can increase in 3 different areas that are power, accuracy, and luck with the 6 different characters available. The main mode is the Pro Tournament and it is where the player plays against over 30 computer players (all playing different holes) with the objective to score lower than the other players (as per the rules of golf). Based on performance the player can earn experience points (XP) that they can use to upgrade the power, accuracy, and luck of the character for future tournaments. Some of the holes have awards like ‘longest drive’ and ‘hole in one’ awards that can earn bonus XP.     \n\nRegardless of the mode the game is played in the same sort of way. The player selects a character (the selection depends on the mode) and then sets up the character by naming and picking their style.  In all modes but Practice the player must pick 3 golf clubs that they must remove from their selection of 17 different clubs (1-5 wood, 1-9 Iron, Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and Putter). When playing the player is presented with a top down view where the player lines up the shot and the location on the golf ball they want to hit (for spin). Then the player selects the club they want to use (all go varying distances). When that is all done the player must play the skill part of the game, where they are presented with a power bar that has a marker that going is up and down along it. The player must stop the marker on the red area in the centre of the power bar to get a good hit (with the center been a perfect hit)and if this area is missed the ball will only travel about 20 yards (compared to about 100+ yards of a good hit). The amount of red that is on the power bar depends on the golf club used. To help the player the distance of the shot can be lowered in exchange for a lower marker speed and can be used for shots closer to the hole (very helpful for putter shots). The game uses battery backed RAM save to continue play later.",

The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one ‘professional foul’ (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.",

For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car.

Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.\n\nT2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.\n\nAssets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000.

The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.\n\nThe question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. \n\nOne additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories.

A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.\n\nGraphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. \n\nThe series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.",

It has two game modes: story and versus.\n\nIn the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the player must fight against Dural.\n\nThe versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection.\n\nThe Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with anime style cutscenes.\n\nIn regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.",

You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few.

With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together.\n\nEventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land.

He can also collect the Telepathy Ball that will help him read people's minds.\n\nLater, Alex learns that in order to save Radactian from destruction, he must first defeat Janken the Great, Emperor of the planet Janbarik (he got his name from his expertise at the game of Janken -- or what people call \"scissors, paper, stone\" in the Western World. Janken has sent his henceman all over Radactian to prepare the game for Alex as he passes by them. In order to get past them, Alex must win three times at Janken.

There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens.

However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.\n\nAt the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery.

There are also satellite weapons that can be attached to the ship.\n\nThe game consists in three levels, at the end of which Sapo Xulé must destroy one scientist's submarine.

Still, the fact that you have a Mio egg should not be known to everyone, since scientists will be very keen to take the animal from you for purposes of their studies.\n\nYour quest for the well-being, and eventual mystery, of the Mio animal takes you on a quest across several planets, not too far from the planet system of Phantasy Star. The game is controlled using an interface popular in Japanese adventures of the eighties, mostly identical with ICOM's interface used in adventures from the same era, such as Shadowgate or Déjà vu. You can talk to people in the game by deciding whom to talk to and the topic, but these interrogations have little in common with the more interactive LucasArts adventures. Finding out things is often a matter of repeatedly asking, asking at the right moment or in the right order. Battery-backed up RAM is not used for saving, instead you are given a password when quitting.",

This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.\n\nLike her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

Sapo Xulé was asked to perform this mission and destroy the powerful scientists' submarine ships.\n\nSapo Xulé: S.O.S. Lagoa Poluída (which means Sapo Xulé: S.O.S. Polluted Lagoon) is a modified version of Astro Warrior, with its space ship replaced by a submarine ship driven by Sapo Xulé, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the 80's: a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.\n\nThis game is a basic shoot-em-up, but instead of destroying space ships and aliens, the player must destroy the scientists' facilities and clean up the lagoon, by destroying the trash in it – the lagoon is filled with matches, eaten apples, cotton swabs, boots and other kinds of junk.\n\nSapo Xulé's ship can be upgraded by collecting leaves (which will make it faster) and flies inside bubbles (which will improve its fire power). There are also satellite weapons that can be attached to the ship.\n\nThe game consists in three levels, at the end of which Sapo Xulé must destroy one scientist's submarine. Once all the three scientists are defeated, they are revived and Sapo Xulé is sent back where he started, in a never-ending circle.",

Now, Sapo Xulé, along with his three friends (Ratopulga, Porcopum and Tartafede) must to stop the cruel tyrant.\n\nSapo Xulé vs. Os Invasores do Brejo (which translates Sapo Xulé vs. The Swamp Invaders) is a modified version of Psycho Fox, with its main character replaced by Sapo Xulé, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the '80s; a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.\n\nIn Psycho Fox, the player could also play as three other characters during the game: Hippo, Monkey Boy and Leopard. In Sapo Xulé vs. Os Invasores do Brejo, they were replaced by Porcopum (a pig), Ratopulga (a mouse) and Tartafede (a turtle).\n\nEach character has its own special ability: Porcopum can break rock walls (but he's considerably slower than the others). Ratopulga can jump higher than any other character, while Tartafede is the fastest one. Sapo Xulé is the most balanced of them.\n\nIn this side-scrolling/platform game, all characters can kill their enemies by punching or jumping on top of them, until they are completely buried. If they are not buried completely, the enemies will pop out of the ground and come after the character again. Besides the monsters, other common obstacles are spikes, cannonballs, fireballs, pits and more.\n\nThe characters can also find Sapo Xulé's stinky shoes, which can be used as a boomerang-like weapon. If they are hit when carrying the shoe, they'll just lose it instead of dying.\n\nTo switch among the characters, the player must find green potions, usually hidden inside eggs, or carried by enemies. Other special items can be collected, such as \"invincibility flies\", Sapo Xulé's stinky socks (which kill every enemy on the screen) and some white bags, which are meant to be used at the bonus stages.\n\nThe bonus stages consist of labyrinths with several paths, each leading to prizes or nothing at all. Each white bag collected at the main stages give the player an extra character to set up for a different path at the labyrinth, raising the chances of reaching a prize in the end.\n\nApart from changes in the main characters, some enemy sprites were replaced, such as the first boss - which came to be Sibila, the sorceress snake - and obviously the last one - which came to be Sapo Boi.",
