    "original_desc": "In Driver, the driving (pun intended) force of the world is crime. The main character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. \n\nBasically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. \n\nDriver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.\n\nDriver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save system to keep your data under wraps.",

Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race!  You'll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto!\n\nMickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey's Racing Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.\n\nThe Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style.  You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you're given points based on your placing.  The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).\n\nThere is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every race.  Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'.  In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving.  The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.\n\nMickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.

One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island.  The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or \"evolve\" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well.  Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.\n\nThe battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.\n\nThere are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker.\n\nAs the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island.  Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.",

This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. \n\nDuring boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent.

Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower.\n\nYou control Koh and his party of \"familiars\" in this unusual \"monster-taming\" RPG.

One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island.  The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or \"evolve\" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well.  Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.\n\nThe battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.\n\nThere are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker.\n\nAs the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island.  Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.",

Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.\n\nThis title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the \"Instant Fun\" option. They vary from a \"Memory\" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as \"Throw a Roman Mini Game\".\n\nBoth Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).",

Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.\n\nThere are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.\n\nThe game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....\n\nLastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of \"Classic Asteroids\" now appearing on the main menu.",

This will impart information about the song to your furby teaching it to warble Für Elise when you least expect it.\n\nYou may also select a Furby to dance with in the game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced.

Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It's up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you'll have to find the one that works best for you.

(Rockman X Gold), and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster Man.  \n \nhe GBC version has similar graphics and levels, but has completely different music. Most of the graphics are taken from the Famicom version, including some unused enemy graphics. Also, the gameplay is changed to a more traditional Megaman-styled game and there are no shops or additional weapons in the game.  The level architecture in most of the levels is partially based on the level design from the NES game (usually at the beginning of a stage) although with accommodations made for your character's lack of a fly ability. The bosses require proper timing with hits like the NES version, except they're vulnerable for a much shorter time. Clearing all the stages yields no ending, as the game doesn't record bosses being defeated like a traditional Mega Man game. Two versions of this game exist: A \"Rocman X\" version featuring slightly edited Mega Man sprites and very slightly lower aim, and the more well-known \"Thunder Blast Man\" version, featuring the protagonist of the NES game. This version shares numerous similarities with Makon Soft games, particularly Rocman 8 and X4.",

The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)\n\nIn Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.",

To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the \nbig points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple \"ditch-a-hot-car\" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.\n\nCriminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.\n\nThe entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted).

The top half contains eight columns, followed by a striped line, and then an empty white area.  To the left of the game screen is the time bar.  As you complete rounds, the bar increases.  When the bar reaches the top of the clock, the level is complete.  If your white area fills up beyond the striped lines, the game is over.\n\nEach round has eight notes played in a specific rhythm.  After they are played, they play again, and this time, after each note is played, circles fall down the columns.  Your goal is to press a button when the circles hit the striped line, which turns them into colored circles with either arrows, A or B on them.  These then land in the bin.  If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn into black angry face circles, which are more difficult to clear.  Perform enough beats correctly and happy face circles will appear - these act as wildcards.\n\nWhen three or more colored circles line up horizontally, they clear from the screen and points are scored.  While you could complete levels by simply pressing the same button in time over and over, the other buttons can be used to set up combos, allowing for bigger points.  In addition, if you press a note incorrectly, sometimes a different button symbol will fall instead, which you must then strategically try to clear.",

There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods.\n\nThe GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.",

To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the \nbig points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple \"ditch-a-hot-car\" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.\n\nCriminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.\n\nThe entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.",

The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.

While traveling, you will discover something more nefarious is happening, and you'll have your hands full of monsters and enemies. Throughout your journey you will have to battle these monsters and enemies in turn-based combat with a twist.

The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.\nThe difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.\n\nWhile it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.",

LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENY for the Game Boy Color is just what the name implies, a frenzied pinball game. There are two different boards that can be played on, each with several variations of their own. The Ariel board contains paddles that are put at varying places to throw off people too used to traditional pinball machines, and it makes them learn some new strategies. The Melody board has many different ramps and drop spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes with a built-in Rumble Pak, guaranteed to deliver plenty of shaking to help make the game a more realistic experience. LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENZY delivers a pinball experience geared toward young players, but has enough gameplay and variation to please most any fan of the genre.",

You take the role of Nicky as he travels through 24 levels, where he must collect a certain number of items or destroy demons.

In each of the 120 levels an insect has to be saved and the three have to combine their skills to puzzle their way through the spider's web, in a similar vein as The Lost Vikings.\n\nThe game was released in Europe only and is identical to The New Adventures of Mary Kate and Ashley, but with a different license. The same engine was later also re-used in Mary-Kate and Ashley Get a Clue.",

They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. There are 32 races which are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs.\n\nThe Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.",

When you start the game, you have the choice of playing in the Arcade or Season mode. Arcade has you pick a team and try to defeat all of the other teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the grueling NFL season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl. No matter how you play the game, you will not miss a second of the action, thanks to three different camera angles. Try to keep your helmet on while playing NFL BLITZ 2000.",

As the blob-like \"puyos\" start falling in your play area, you must align them and create groups of the same color in order to clear the screen before you get flooded with puyos. Chaining puyos of different colors allows you to send several \"garbage\" puyos to the opposing player's play area in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the next challenger.\n\nNew for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage.

Like its predecessor, the game was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo, and was first announced in January 2001 by Japanese website WatchImpress. It includes new enhancements, such as the ability to choose the gender of the player character, a training mode to help new players, a Deck Diagnosis to rate the effectiveness of a player's deck, and a new group of antagonists known as Team Great Rocket. The game features all cards from the original game, along with new cards from the fourth set, Team Rocket, as well as cards originally exclusive to Japanese vending machines and the Pokémon Trading Card Game Instructional Video Intro Pack, bringing the total number of cards to 445.  \n \nLike the previous title, players must travel across the game world challenging non-player characters to simulated battles using rules adopted from the original tabletop version. All locations from the original are present, along with a new setting known as GR Island which contains its own Battle Masters for players to encounter. By defeating a total of 16 Battle Masters on the old and new islands, players may challenge the game's final boss, King Biruritchi. Though an English release in North America was deemed \"likely\" by website IGN in 2001, the game has not been made available outside Japan. Pokémon Card GB2 earned a 29 out of 40 score from Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine.",

Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them.

    "original_desc": "Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. \n\nShortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.\n\nIn all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. \n\nDuring boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.",

The game is a platformer with action elements. Each level requires a puzzle to be solved within a time limit, giving the successful player a key to unlock the next level. Bad monsters will attack on most levels, so in addition to moving blocks to get to the key on each level, a player needs to dispatch bad monsters before being killed by them. There are good monsters to meet, several hidden bonus levels, bonus items, and treasure to be found.",

And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!\n\nSpace Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.\n\nYou can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.",

It is the first sequel in the Tales series, which normally does not have connected storylines.

Most of the graphics are taken from the Famicom version, including some unused enemy graphics. Also, the gameplay is changed to a more traditional Mega Man-styled game and there are no shops or additional weapons in the game.  \nTwo versions of this game exist: A \"Rocman X\" version featuring slightly edited Mega Man sprites and very slightly lower aim, and the more well-known \"Thunder Blast Man\" version, featuring the protagonist of the NES game. This version shares numerous similarities with Makon Soft games, particularly Rocman 8 and X4.",

Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on the map and determine the course of action.\n\nThe actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.",

The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.\n\nIt is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.\n\n \nYou start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.\n\nThe Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps & trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.",

The time is limited, the screen can be scrolled left and right and the ultimate goal is to improve the own highscore. \n \nIn this game the only background is set at a sea. New features are more different animals to shoot, including the \"Lesshühner\" which give negative points. Two new ammo types are more powerful but limited and have to be earned by shooting certain things. There are multiple hidden extras to find, e.g. ways to extend the playing time.",
