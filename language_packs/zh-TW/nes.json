This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.\n\nYou play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gang’s arch enemy – the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it won’t be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.

As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.\n\nThere is more than typical side-scrolling action, although there’s certainly a multitude of that.

    "desc": "《機動戰士鋼彈》（機動戦士ガンダム）或簡稱鋼彈（ガンダム），是由富野由悠季與矢立肇為日升工作室創作的日本動畫系列，始於1979年。作為機甲題材作品，它包含太空戰爭、科技先進世界等科幻經典元素，但通過敘事與技術細節追求現實主義而實現創新。這一系列首次將巨型機器人——機甲題材的核心——降格為大規模量產武器。這一革新理念反映了動畫傳統受眾向成年群體的拓展，由此誕生了日本科幻的子類型「真實系機器人」。\n\n儘管起步艱難，鋼彈在1980年代初取得成功並持續至今；該系列已推出約30部動畫、OVA及電影，另有數十部漫畫、小說、電子遊戲乃至通過SD鋼彈衍生的惡搞作品。雖視聽作品構成系列核心，但鋼彈系列實際依託衍生產品（特別是鋼普拉）作為第二支柱。從經濟角度看，該系列是萬代南夢宮最盈利的IP，年收入約5000億日元。多數批評聚焦於擔憂經濟需求可能壓倒創作需求。\n鋼彈系列的成功首要體現在文化層面：鋼彈在中文文化圈裡有一定的知名度，在法語區幾近無名，但在日本卻是一個深刻的社會現象。多數學術研究者明確認定鋼彈系列對日本動畫與流行文化影響重大，常將系列與西方的《星球大戰》相比。這種影響具象化於日本日常生活的方方面面，無論是廣告、專賣店、藝術展覽，還是在東京附近建造的18米高立像。然而鋼彈系列未能稱霸全球，海外推廣有限且常與超時空要塞系列、新世紀福音戰士系列等作品競爭。",

It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.\n\nAlthough the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.",

The famous painter Mamiya Ichirou lived many years in a secluded mansion, and rumor says there are some valuable frescos to find inside. Our investigators decide to take some pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure of Mamiya appears  and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\n\n\"Sweet Home\" is perhaps the first known example of survival horror genre, created by the same company that later made the famous  Resident Evil. However, \"Sweet Home\" is also a console-style RPG: characters fight random monsters in turn-based battles, equip various weapons and level up. You can (and must) form different teams from the five available characters, both for battles and for solving puzzles. Each character has his (or her) own item-based skill: Taro can take pictures, Emi can unlock almost any door, Kazuo has a lighter, Akiko uses a vacuum cleaner to remove dust and other obstacles, and Asuka has medical kits.\n\nThe game was never released outside of Japan.",
