As usual in this type of games you type in the commands that the character should perform instead of controlling the game directly. Special about this text parser is, that it wants to have the object first and then the verb. Most text parsers work the other way around. The story is about an old book that sparked your curiosity. It is about the north pole scientist Scott. But not only that he had to pay with his life for traveling to the north pole, but also that he left a treasure in the ice. Fascinated you collect more information about Scotts expedition which leads you to the conclusion that the treasure really exists. Now you really want to start your own expedition to the north pole, but already in your home city you run into the first problems which are not easy to solve.",

To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move. To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened. Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.",

Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).",

Sitting in cockpit of your skimmer, you may examine the view in first-person perspective, accelerate, decelerate your skimmer, turn left or right, and shoot the enemy vehicles. During your mission, radar helps you to detect the enemies out of your view, but fuel is exhausting, and shields are decreasing with enemy shots.",

Your goal is to search artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. Each sector of the planet is filled with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ship's radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. Shooting these will reduce your ship's radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again. The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.",

Like all good Guardians they are out to stop any rescuing or recovering they might happen to see going down! You take control of Little Devil and the aim is to get him through the levels of hell to the Castle and the Princess, freeing as many souls as possible along the way.

Schreckenstein is a platform maze game designed to be played by two players, with each player's surroundings shown in either the top or bottom half of the screen. If a single player is selected, the computer operates the second player. In each level, the players must traverse the maze collecting health elixirs and level specific objects while avoiding spooks, bats, spiders and miscellaneous traps. Each player can throw a weapon to dispatch their enemies.",

There are items though that help you get around the screen like springboards, lifts and bridge builders. You cannot fall too far downwards and if you do fall or hit an obstacle then you lose one of three lives. Once all the flags have been raised then you go to the finish and it's off to the next level. Two players can play with the 2nd player playing as Jaques and both players play on the same screen trying to raise their flags before the other player.

Jupiter is the largest and most spectacular of the planets in our solar system. Its gravitational and magnetic fields are incredibly powerful, and extend millions of miles into space. The Voyagers used the gravitational fields of Jupiter as a kind of \"sling shot\" to whip the craft out to the farthest planets in the solar system. Jupiter's largest moons-lo, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto - range in size from slightly smaller than our moon to a little larger than the planet Mercury. They were the first bodies in the solar system to be discovered with a telescope by Galileo in 1610. Jupiter's other moons are much smaller. One moon, Anathea, is cigar-shaped. The moon lo is particularly interesting because it has visible volcanoes on its surface. The three moons lo, Europa and Ganymede were picked for bases in this game. They are appropriate landing sites for spacecraft because they had solid, relatively smooth surfaces. Jupiter itself is a monstrous ball of liquid and gas, with no solid surface to land \non.",

All trade goods created by the people of Zorel 6 must pass inspection by the Orelian Guards, and only those goods deemed necessary for galactic security are allowed to pass outside the planet. All other items are dispersed to the Council's burgeoning warehouse. To enforce this action, a massive interstellar fleet has positioned itself over Zorel 6, closely monitoring the movement of all goods. You play as a smuggler, who must sneak between the patrolling Galactic fleet, evade a patrolling robot ship, and attach yourself to cargo before it reached the Council warehouse. You must then deliver the cargo to an awaiting Vorox transport ship high above the blockade. The player must complete progressively more difficult levels featuring more advanced enemy patrols. Players are awarded points based upon which cargo they recover, and gain an additional ship for every 5000 points gained. Stage 1 requires recovery of 8 pieces of cargo, and each progressive stage requires 2 more pieces. The player must recover all pieces before they run out of fuel, or they crash. The player will lose a shuttle if they strike any enemy vessel, a building, or are shot.",

Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls.

The colonizers can only be inactivated by picking up a tricasmium nugget and then flying over the entrance of the colonizer. Your interceptor is armed with a small number of smart bombs, which obliterates enemies on the screen and returns you to your base. Successful destruction of each waves of ships rewards you with another smart bomb.

The goal is to collect a specific number of blots on each stage before returning to one of the 4 bases. On early stages, no blots are required, but as difficulty progresses, more blots are required to complete a level. The player always starts in the middle of the stage, and must avoid the flashing Gamma Field which flits around the screen. In addition, Whirlers follow the purple lines, but destroy the trail behind them, constantly changing the maze. The player loses a life if they contact a Whirler or Gamma Field. There are also thickened blue lines, which allow the player to move at double speed, but they can not exit from the blue line until reaching the end.",

Members of the Gorgolyte race and Trolloboar tanks are targeting you. A set of randomly-arranged lines are already in place, and contact with them pushes them in the direction of contact. Forming a complete square locks it into place, and it turns into either a monster (causing death on contact), a woman (resulting in bonus points on contact) or a barrier. They will randomly change into stairways, which can lead you into a bonus room.",

Gameplay consists of missions where the primary directive is to navigate the submarine to track and intercept enemy warships on the randomly created map and close in for the kill with torpedoes. Combat itself consists of a direct visual of enemy ships (via periscope) and firing torpedoes at the correct angle to ultimately sink the ship. Be warned that although the player has the element of surprise of a submerged vessel, enemy ships will return fire. When all hell breaks loose, a disclosed submarine is a sitting duck to Japanese guns. Be prepared to direct the damage control team to fix up the damaged submarine when under fire. The mission ends when the player has successfully eliminated all targets on the map.",

To do this, you must walk over each segment of the framework in the mines. To reach each segment of framework, you will need to figure out a way to jump, climb, or use one of the many devices occasionally available to get there. To your help you get around (or sometimes hinder progress) are ladders, slides, suction tubes, cannons, transporters, and other devices. Wandering about the mines are many dangerous mutants. If you come in contact with one of these, you will lose a life. Scattered throughout each mine are special food items; collect one of these, and you will temporarily be able to eliminate the mutants by walking into them. You will need to figure out a unique strategy for each level in order to complete it, plus there is a time limit so claim all the territory quickly!",

    "original_desc": "Bounty Bob Strikes Back! is the sequel to Miner 2049er and features similar gameplay. As Bounty Bob, your goal is to claim every inch of 25 challenging mines. To do this, you must walk over each segment of the framework in the mines. To reach each segment of framework, you will need to figure out a way to jump, climb, or use one of the many devices occasionally available to get there. To your help you get around (or sometimes hinder progress) are ladders, slides, suction tubes, cannons, transporters, and other devices. Wandering about the mines are many dangerous mutants. If you come in contact with one of these, you will lose a life. Scattered throughout each mine are special food items; collect one of these, and you will temporarily be able to eliminate the mutants by walking into them. You will need to figure out a unique strategy for each level in order to complete it, plus there is a time limit so claim all the territory quickly!",

Each set of commands causes 6 hours of gameplay to pass. Weather, terrain, and time of day effects troop movement.

The missiles silos have many defenses which the terrorists also control; pillboxes, tanks, jeeps, and cruise missiles are all capable of destroying your tank. Should you attempt to guess the fail safe code, clues can be found by docking at supply depots. The code is three letters long, and can consist of any combination of L, E and O. When you enter a war room, you have a very short time to enter the code correctly or the missiles will launch. When the missiles have been stopped (by either means), the level is complete and you continue on to the next, more difficult round.",

The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.",

Diagons are bird-like creatures which will move inexorably at a 45 degree angle, and can be destroyed by trapping between two parallel trails. Snarfs are defenseless creatures which will mutate into Snuffers or Diagons after an unpredictable time.

While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.",

Most of the way, you use one object in some way to gain another.\n\nGolden Baton uses the Scott Adams adventure engine, and thus has the same features - a basic 2-word parser, limited vocabulary (object names plus standard words such as EXAMINE, WEAR and DROP), and brief descriptions. A Help command is also available which provides hints. Although primitive by later standards, these compare favourably to other interactive fiction of the time.",

There are enemies on the way, such as birds and frogs; Fred can defend himself by tossing rocks that travel in an arc, though ammunition is limited, but Fred can pick up new rocks along the way. Another weapon is the spray can; when found, Fred can spray in front of himself, killing enemies this way. Contact with an enemy or a hazard (such as a cactus) costs a life and sends the player back to the last checkpoint. Weapons can also be used to crack open jugs found along the way. There are pick-ups to find inside, such as rocks, ammunition for the spray can, a cap that protects from a single loss of life, or shields that make Fred immune to all dangers.",

You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death. He will also find amulets which make him invulnerable for a short time.

Each level has one or more golf balls that the player has to pick up and carry back to the starting position. He can only carry one ball at a time so he has to move past the dangers multiple times before a level is completed. Points are earned for each golf ball recovered.

Wadsworth is armed with a cloak which makes him invulnerable to enemy attack for a a limited period of time each level. Each level of difficulty consists of 3 rooms separated by a doorway. The goal is to walk over all areas of the map to turn them purple. When all squares are colored in all 3 rooms, the player advances to the next level.

Take care however as you must avoid oncoming traffic, puddles and trees by the roadside if you are to complete The California Run. On completion, your score is given.

Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.",

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them. Instead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.",

Gameplay consists of missions where the primary directive is to navigate the submarine to track and intercept enemy warships on the randomly created map and close in for the kill with torpedoes. Combat itself consists of a direct visual of enemy ships (via periscope) and firing torpedoes at the correct angle to ultimately sink the ship. Be warned that although the player has the element of surprise of a submerged vessel, enemy ships will return fire. When all hell breaks loose, a disclosed submarine is a sitting duck to Japanese guns. Be prepared to direct the damage control team to fix up the damaged submarine when under fire. The mission ends when the player has successfully eliminated all targets on the map.",

The snakes grow in size as the game goes on and if the player attacks one in the middle it will split and the two halves go in different directions. Like in Pac-Man there are guards, the Serpent Security Force, that are out to get the player. There are three of them roaming the maze and if they make contact with the player a life is lost. There is one way to take out the guards though. If the player eats a snake that a guard is touching, the guard too will get eaten. The game ends when all of the player's three lives are lost.",

However, everything is in real-time and therefore the complexity has been toned down. The only thing the player does is giving move orders by choosing a unit and moving the cursor to the place it should move to. Those orders are not carried out instantly; each movement takes a certain amount of time depending on terrain and unit type. Battles are initiated automatically when a unit moves close to a hostile. Then they basically exchange blows until one unit lost all of its soldiers. The game also factors in fatigue and morale. \nThe time is measured with an in-game clock and a match ends after eleven hours (30 minutes in real-time). If the player has won a match depends on the reached score which is based on the casualties.",

Eight of the nine lamps may be found randomly scattered around the kingdom (in locations which change with each new game), but the ninth lamp, the black lamp, is guarded by a dragon which must be defeated before the lamp can be recovered.  \nEach lamp must be returned to one of several lamp racks in the kingdom. As the player can only carry a single lamp at a time, this can mean a lot of traveling back and forth. Once all the lamps have been returned to the rack, the level is complete, and the player advances to the next level. The game takes place across a series of static and scrolling rooms, which are connected by doorways leading into the foreground or background, as well as up down, left and right.",

You can jump and thus avoid these holes, although you have a limited number of them for each level, and it's possible to adjust the speed through joystick or keyboard control. You also face a time limit on each of the levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one",

The bad news is: you're a police officer patrolling the streets, and you have two other police officers at your side. Your job is to shoot the little troublemakers that approach you. When you are killed by one of the troublemakers, one of the policemen replaces you as the one who gets to control the streets. When you come to the intersection, you'll come face-to-face with a gang, and you must shoot each gang member before they have a chance to leave you for dead. Once you've shoot all remaining gang members, a man appears holding a woman hostage. The object here is to shoot the man to free her. If you shoot the woman instead, you'll sacrifice 1000 points. Your score increases when you walk, but score more points if you manage to shoot a troublemaker.",

The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.",

There are various nasties and obstacles on each level which need to be avoided or you lose one of three lives. As well being able to jump, Nurds have a special feature, rotor blades fitted to their head which enables them to fly around if the firebutton is held down. If your Nurd touches a wall or platform (not deadly), or you release the fire button then they will float back to the ground but can't fly until they touch solid ground. Once the four pieces of food are collected then it's off to the next level.",

    "original_desc": "The story began years ago on the campus of a large university. You were a first-year student who spent more time learning how to sufi dance with a local whirling dirvish than studying. Your brother, while always a bit more clumsy and scatter-brained than you, somehow managed to graduate with a doctorate and was immediately offered a research position in the archeology department. \n \nTrouble began when your brother returned from a year-long research expedition in the rain forests of South America. Not only did he return without any of the tools he'd borrowed from the university, but he had no notes documenting how he had spent his year. Out of concern for your brother's future and intrigued by his repeated mumbling about priceless ancient artifacts, you decide to retrace his steps.",

Here you try to negotiate with Lord Holders of Craftsmasters to make allies in your fight against the Thread. When diplomatic maneuvers fail you, you may be forced to resort to a duel -- a wounded leader is unable to take any actions for a long time --, but this may jeopardize your status with peaceful leaders. Finally, conclaves may be called up after certain events like the death of a Weyrleader.  \nThread fighting occurs at the end of each year. During this phase of the game, you mount your dragons and you must pursue the falling Thread and char it in midair with the dragon's fiery breath before it lands. Miss a Thread and it may destroy you... or hit the ground and turn the land to dust.",

It is designed to be played with an eight-direction joystick and each direction translates into a different move: moving left or right, jumping straight up or over something, high or low kick, body kick and jab. Each successful attack against the opponent means that his pain bar goes up, but it will go down fast if pressure is not kept up. When the bar is full, the POW symbol blinks and the fighter will go down with the next hit. He will recover after a few seconds, but an eighth of the bar will be permanently stuck in pain. The match ends when a fighter goes down eight times or the timer runs out. If the player is the winner, the next match features a more difficult opponent. Two air vents are installed on each side of the screen. Sometimes scorpions fall out of these vents and the player should avoid them because of their deadly sting. Before starting the game, the player can choose between a slow and fast playing mode.",

When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.",

There are also timing-based hazards such as arrows emerging from walls and lazer beams - contact with any of these costs one of your five lives. You also lose a life if you run out of energy. Some levels vary the format by requiring you to simply collect every note on a single screen, which has regeneration points and one-way platforms.",

The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.",

Below the surface, tunnels and sewers are left only partially damaged, but they are inhabited by creatures which can eliminate your team. Your only defense is your cleverness and speed. At first, the money are plentiful. After every trip back to the surface, more appear right below. But as the search continues, you are forced to look deeper. Eventually the creatures seem more aggressive. If you can recover enough money the bank will give you an advance to hire another raider.",

The weapon system constantly fires, and the fire button is used to change the current weapon. The basic weapon is the Orbiter, which the player always has. Picking up weapon icons increases the power of a weapon by 1 up to the maximum of power level 4. Dying reduces the current weapon by 1 power level, or loses it if the weapon is power 1 (with the exception of the Orbiter). As the weapons get more power, their fire rate becomes faster and the bullets stronger. The five weapons are Orbiter, 8-way (upgrades from 2 to 4 to 6 to 8 way fire), Railgun (powerful single bullet which gets longer) Pulse (fires straight forward and gains diagonal fire at power 3/4) and Wall (another forward fire, which gains size).",

The music changes dynamically and becomes more intense when the invader and defender are close to each other.

Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment. For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.",

The \"Sidewinder\" mission. Computer selection, after many considerations, has chosen you as the only possible candidate for the second Sidewinder mission. The mission will begin when we have obtained more data. \n \nBRIEFING UPDATE: Covert intelligence report a possible weak point has been found. Access to the alien battle station is via a tunnel used to vent any excess energy. Lining the tunnel are defensive positions which may be destroyed. There are also a large number of venting doors. These automatically open and close and cannot be destroyed. They must be avoided. Finally, manteinance and defence drones patrol the ducts watching for faults and space scavengers. To help you, extra weaponry will be 'ported' in so you must watch out for these and collect them. The extra weaponry includes lasers and multi shots.",

Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!",

The grid is removed as the player or the fuses move across it which means the player can't turn around and move in the opposite direction. It also means that he has to plan his movements to avoid reaching a dead end. The same is true for the fuses who will burn out when reaching a dead end. A level is cleared when the player has collected all the dynamite or when all fuses have been burned out. The player then moves on to another level with a different grid layout. Points are earned by picking up dynamite and for crossing grid junctions.",

One of the features of the environment are the constantly changing walls, ie the individual blocks of the walls change their position as you make your way through. There is also a time limit, failing to exit a room under the given time results in an untimely death. A two-player option is available where two players can take turns and see who collects the highest amount of points.",

Volta's castle is guarded by several of his nasty beasts: bats, scorpions, giant ants, fire-breathing dragons, floating eyeballs, and even a huge electrical generator gone haywire -- you'll soon realize why he calls himself \"Volta\".",

The player takes control of a safari hunter who is searching for an ape named Bongo, determined to punish him for setting the hunter's tent on fire. The game consists of four one-screen stages, each with an objective to jump on platforms and reach the top. Various animals will try to stop the protagonist: for example, in the first level a large gorilla throws coconuts at him. The hero has no offensive abilities and must jump or otherwise avoid enemy attacks. Stages may contain obstacles or hazardous spots that would kill off the main character.",

The Beamrider is equipped with a short-range laser lariat and a limited supply of torpedoes. The player is given three at the start of each sector. To clear a sector, fifteen enemy ships must be destroyed. A \"Sentinel ship\" will then appear, which can be destroyed using a torpedo (if any remain) for bonus points. Some enemy ships can only be destroyed with torpedoes, and some must simply be dodged. Occasionally during a sector, \"Yellow Rejuvenators\" (extra lives) appear. They can be picked up for an extra ship, but if they are shot they will transform into ship-damaging debris. Activision offered a Beamrider patch to players who could get to Sector 14 with 40,000 points and sent in a screenshot of their accomplishment.",

Controlling the ship involves side scrolling to the left or right, stop, moving forward (and faster), and moving backwards/break (and slower). Additionally, the spaceship can also fire its weapon to unleash a pair of energy bolts. The game ends when the player loses all three lives by crashing into (or being crashed by, it seems sometimes) pylons or enemy space ships. Although there is no penalty in avoiding pylons altogether, the game will also end if the allocated amount of time (indicated by a long bar at the top center screen) runs out. The player may increase speed to move faster, which will present maneuverability challenges in itself. The overall score increases by distance traveled, pylons traveled through, and enemy spaceships shot down. The latest score and the high score are saved and shown in the main menu.",

Games can be saved to disk, but you need the Adventure Creator cartridge to play them. Adventures can also be automatically randomly generated. \nThe games you create are fairly limited, with only one monster allowed per screen, and three types of weapons to hobble the monster with. The goal of the adventures is to find some named object. However the object you seek is really only a name, and is not represented graphically.",

Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.",

You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.",

Can you reach the ball and 'kick it back' before it leaves the field of play ? \nThis is an exciting game with five skill levels.

Find the needed objects (money, passport, secret plans and airport door key) by searching rooms in the embassy, which include desks, file cabinets and other furniture. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance). Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example). When all the items are together in the secret briefcase, head for the airport door. \n \nFights ensue when both spies enter the same room and are armed with clubs.",

New trap items include a saw (for cutting holes in ice), a plunger detonator (with dynamite), an ice pick and snowshoes. There are some pitfalls (thin ice and snow drifts). Hand-to-hand combat is done with snowballs. Watch your spy's body heat or he'll become a permanent resident.",

It seems like the only hope is for a skilled pilot such as yourself to make a solo attack on Gemini, using your laser cannon and Quark bomb to devastate their installations and ships. Gameplay replicates Scramble, being viewed side on with gradual scrolling. You infiltrate the cavernous system, avoiding contact with the spiked walls and gun turrets, or with the many ships and bombs they scramble to block you. The final challenge is to shoot an airlock open, with an accurate central shot. You must pass through it several times, with more and more enemies each time. You have limited ammunition and fuel, and use fuel more quickly when travelling faster. Fortunately, the cavern has many supply dumps, whose contents of either fuel (F) or ammo (A) can be stolen by shooting the surrounding shields centrally.",

Navigating the levels is accomplished with the directional buttons and a jump button.

Points are gathered in the form of gems that appear randomly in rooms. Players pass through the gems for collection. Airball can ascend stairs by jumping. The surrounding spikes, one of many obstacles found in the game, cause the player to burst.

The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.",

Flight Simulator II is packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace. In this game the plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.

When at normal speed the player can only move one lane at a time, while at double speed he can move two. On all lanes there are dots that have to be collected to be able to move on to the next level. The game ends after five crashes. There are a number of variants of the game, with different options turned on or off. This include choosing if dots should be restored after a crash, whether there should be one or two computer controlled cars and whether the crash cars can accelerate or not. The game can be played by up to four players who take turns playing. There is also a competitive mode where one player takes control of the crash car and has to hit the other player.",

Rockford digs feverishly, as boulders crash down all around him, through 16 mystical caves and 5 levels of difficulties. \nIn his restless quest for gleaming jewels, Rockford works around walls of rock and avoids swirling fireflies. To win, he must turn his enemies into opportunities! He drops boulders through an enchanted wall, blocks the growing amoebas, transform butterflies – magically turning them into precious stones! If he collects his required number of diamonds, the mysterious escape tunnel is revealed. After every 4 caves there is a playable intermission. \nIt will take all the strategy and thought you can muster to master the 'physics' of Boulder Dash. Join Rockford and experience the excitement and beauty that awaits you.",

Downhill has you skiing down the mountain, moving left or right, avoiding obstacles like trees on the side of the screen, rocks, bumps and logs and when touched causes you to crash and lose valuable seconds. You can accelerate your skier and ice patches allow you to go faster, but hitting ski's slows you down. Target Jump has you waggling left and right to pick up speed before jumping of a ramp. You move your skier up or down to land as close to the centre of a target. To finish the game you now attempt Slalom where you must go through gates made up of flags.",

At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch.",

During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. \n \nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions starring Pac-Man and the ghosts.",

L'objectif principal du jeu est de marquer autant de points que possible. De nombreux flippers modernes incluent un scénario dans lequel le joueur doit remplir certains objectifs d'une manière particulière pour compléter l'histoire, obtenant généralement des scores élevés pour différentes méthodes de jeu. Des points sont gagnés lorsque le ballon frappe différentes cibles sur le terrain de jeu. Un drain est situé au bas du terrain de jeu, partiellement protégé par des battes en plastique contrôlées par le joueur, appelées palmes. Une partie se termine lorsque toutes les balles tombent dans le drain un certain nombre de fois. Les objectifs secondaires sont de maximiser le temps passé à jouer (en gagnant des \"balles supplémentaires\" et en gardant la balle en jeu aussi longtemps que possible) et de gagner des jeux bonus (connus sous le nom de \"replays\").",

Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however. \n \nThere are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders. On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.",

The creatures in this cave, sensing the energy emanating from the Eidolon, are woken from a long slumber, and you soon finds that his only chance of survival lies in this mysterious vehicle and its powerful energy weapon. The objective is to successfully navigate through all of the game's levels, defeating the dragon guardian at the end of each level. You navigate through each maze and collect energy orbs, which come in four different colors (red, yellow, green and blue). Along the way, various enemies wake up and attack the Eidolon, attempting to absorb its energy. Some enemies also fire orbs at the Eidolon, of which all but the red orbs can be absorbed by pressing the space bar at the right time to replenish the Eidolon's limited energy.",

After lighting up all the rooms in the building, the player is free to leave at the exit door at the bottom of the building. The player has to be careful not to get bit by any of the insects and animals that also occupy the building. These pests can also chew through wire undoing the players hard work (however, if they bite any live wires they will get zapped). The second part of the game involves exploring an animal infested underground sewer area in order to find an entrance to the next building.",

Extra lives are gained by exiting a dungeon, collecting 30 gems, or collecting all of the gems in a level. Energy can be replenished by collecting food items. The player can fire a laser weapon which has a limited range also has a gravity pod, activated by moving \"up\", this allows to jump any distance from a standing position, including between levels of the dungeon. Moving between levels causes all of the monsters to re-spawn. Once per level, the player can activate a short-lived invulnerability mode, which also allows the player to fly (effectively using the gravity pod, while in mid-jump) and kill monsters on contact for about 10 seconds.",

As you launch, the tunnel zooms towards you at high speed until you are ejected under computer control to descend through the yellow acid atmosphere and into battle. \nNow the fun begins. Manual control is returned to you and you must fly your V-wing fighter just like a real plane – forward on the joystick to descend and back to climb. Right and left bank you in the relevant direction. Pressing fire will launch one of your AMB torpedoes, of which you seem to have an ample supply. \nThis game is also known as \"Rescue on Fractalus\"",

Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more.\n\nYou can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war.\n\nHow well will you do when matched against history?",

Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.",

These structures serve as a basis for puzzles which must be solved in-between the fighting in order to proceed. The game features a total of 13 dungeons with 129 different rooms.

The highest score so far is maintained on the display. There are five levels of difficulty in the game ranging from 'Flying School' to 'Group Captain'. At the start of the game, or if you press the 'START' key whilst on the runway, you will be able to select your initial rank with the joystick; subsequently your rank depends on how well you succeed on each mission. If you survive the mission a reconnaissance of the dam area is displayed. If you have breached the dam then you will be promoted to the next rank, otherwise you will be demoted. The game features fine vertical and horizontal scrolling, player-missile graphics and sound, and is suitable for players aged from pre-teenage to adult.",

Ammo and shield (depleted after enemy hits) are limited, but can be replenished by collecting parachutes which are dropped by the home base (a zeppelin) which is stationed somewhere over the planet. One of the most important tasks is to keep it alive because the spawn points (an additional respectively new base appears) are far between - which means the player may have to survive without replenishment for a few levels when the base is destroyed.

You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first.\n\nJinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them.\n\nDialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.",

You have five ships, but there are many ways to lose one. Lazer beams and triangular rays toggle on and off, so require timing and planning to avoid. Argoniks patrol the area, and are fatal to the touch - however, they can work in your favour, as they activate some types of indestructible blocks on contact, changing the blocks' frames from white to red as a signal to you. Most doors are closed by default, and are activated by firing into their brown covers. They can be closed in the same way - this is a defensive tactic to block Argoniks, but make sure you are not in the way of the door as it closes. You can collect and activate shields to deflect and block various hazards - although the ultimate challenge is to complete the game without them.",

Before starting a new game, players can buy up to seven additional lives by purchasing more credits; an extra life is also granted after clearing the first five missions. Unlike similar games where the player can only fire their weapon after an existing shot has disappeared from the screen, the ship is equipped with a laser cannon capable of firing a single vertical shot (called a \"quark laser\") at any time, although doing so causes the previous shot to disappear. Players can advance through the ranks of Space Cadet, Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior and Space Avenger, which increases the speed and difficulty of the game and introduces more enemy patterns.",

The game is split screen and is viewed from the side and scrolls from left to right when you move your bike. You press right to move your bike, move up or down to steer and to change gears you hold down the fire button and press up or down. Certain obstacles like logs and holes can't be ridden over so you press fire to get off your bike and push it. Hitting an object throws you off your bike and wastes time and the winner is the person who finishes the course in the fastest time.",

Each level also contains some warp holes; enter one of these and you will be transported to a new location, which could be useful if you get in trouble. You will also occasionally come across some sonic sparklers; touch one of these, and you will temporarily become invincible.

This creature does not harm you, but if you are caught in his grasp, he will take you elsewhere in the pyramid. There are keys that can be collected, and can open locked doors so that you can visit new chambers in the pyramid. You lose keys when you get carried away by the winged avatar or lose one of your lives. There are three levels. The higher the level, the more treasures you have to get and there are also new chambers. Higher levels require a password, which is revealed after playing the previous level.",

The view then cuts to space, where the player uses the joystick to cause the screen to rapidly scroll in the selected direction, creating the illusion of flight in the chosen direction. The screen is filled with planets and other objects. When the user presses the fire button on the joystick, the stick stops causing the ship to move, and instead fires its weapon in the chosen direction. The ship can simultaneously move and fire in different directions. The enemy aliens attack the player with an endless supply of attack saucers; however, they are but a mere distraction. The real threat to Earth are the 16 Megamines that start at the end of the universe and then slowly make their way towards planet Earth, displayed in the center of the map. If a single Megamine manages to reach Earth, the planet explodes.",

You move on to the next level by completing your tasks or just surviving until 6:00, although more points are awarded for the former. You will also receive bonus points for each Mogwai returned to the cage. On many of the levels there will be various types of food lying about the screen. If a Mogwai eats any food, it will turn into a gremlin. There may also be puddles of water; if a Gremlin or Mogwai runs into the water, it will split into two. Some levels also contain a refrigerator or popcorn machine which will throw food out onto the screen, or a television which will distract the Gremlins. You also begin the game with a limited number of flash cubes; if you get into trouble, you can use these to temporarily stun all of the Gremlins and Mogwai.

As it turns out, you're not alone after all, so you depart from your ship and fly across a sea full of heavily defended islands to reach the enemy stronghold, disable its defenses and rescue your comrades. Should you succeed, you get to try it again at a higher difficulty level, where you'll face enemies with higher firing rates, planes, barrage balloons and missile-armed submarines. All the while you'll have to keep an eye on your dwindling fuel supply. Your jetcopter can fire at any angle it's flying, even straight down. The C64 version scrolls in the opposed direction and has a few smaller differences in the environmental graphics. The Atari 8-Bit version was later re-released with a new TV show license (Airwolf) and a new helicopter model.",

Featuring dual flipper controls, upper and lower playing fields, tilt mechanism, multiple ball play, electromagnetic deflectors, and many special effects, the game represents the first generation of home computer pinball simulations available with relatively realistic pinball features.",

It can't be blown up because there is not enough time to evacuate the area. There is only one possibility, that is to launch an attack on the complex using a prototype helicopter gun-ship heavily armed with powerful cannons and bombs. The brief is - Destroy the complex at all costs. The operation is code-named - Dawn Raider. The pilot chosen for this mission is You.",

(if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed.

From the lands to the north, a hero is sent to help the city and free the princess. He is Gorth, the strongest of the barbarian warriors. With his sword in hand, he has to beat eight of Drax's best warriors and at last the magician himself. He will fight them in the woods, on the mountaintop, in the dungeon... finally reaching Drax's palace itself. \nThis is essentially a one- or two-player fighting game where you control a big barbarian and fight another player or a computer AI. There are several kinds of hits, and some hits take off half a point while others take off a whole point. Each player has six of these \"power points\". They also have a special hard to perform \"death sword\" which decapitates your opponent, killing him with one fell swoop.",

There are patrol planes and anti-aircraft guns, to be certain, but success or failure is decided by the number of trucks you destroy. Fail to get enough, and your supply -- of spare biplanes -- goes down. Of course, rack up enough points, and your supply of planes increases. You'll need them, since not long into your flight, bullets are flying everywhere and chewing up your plane. A counter ticks off the hits at the bottom of the screen right next to the score. At nine, your plane drops like a rock. Fuel and ammo are not a problem; a friendly airstrip will come along at the right time. Friendly from the sky, that is. When you get right down to it, at the wrong angle or a bit too late, that airstrip can be as unfriendly as any other patch of hard ground. The ground may be the most dangerous thing on the screen, since you must dive sharply to strafe the supply trucks, and there's scant room for the loops required to out-maneuver enemy pilots. When that becomes easy, their skill can be upped with two more levels of difficulty.",

During World War II, Mosquitos downed 659 enemy aircraft and 500 V-Buzz Bombs. Your only allies are your wits, your weapons and your radar. Are you equal to the challenge? Down the Nazi bombers, sink de U-boats, outrun the V-Buzz Bombs and stop the enemy trains to release the POWs. Should you fly around a storm or around? Navigate carefully, consult your intelligence reports and maps to make a decision. Choose your weapons and fuel wisely - once your're on a mission, there's no going back. Select one mission or any combination. If you complete all four successfully - and make it back alive - you'll become the most distinguished flight veteran of World War II - the Ace of Aces!",

Visually, the demons appear in waves similar to other space-themed shooters, but individually combine from the sides of the screen to the area above the player's cannon. Each wave introduces new weapons with which the demons attack, such as long streaming lasers and laser clusters. Starting in Wave 5, demons also divide into two smaller, bird-like creatures that eventually attempt descent onto the player's cannon. Starting in Wave 9, the demons' shots follow directly beneath the monsters, making it difficult for the player to slip underneath to get in a direct shot.",

If you shoot your bone and miss, you'll have to retrieve the bone before you can shoot it again. \nEach time a hydrant is claimed, it changes to the color of the claimant and another unclaimed hydrant pops up. As the game progresses, more and more claimed hydrants fill the screen. You can run right through your own hydrants, but if you run into your opponent's hydrants, you're penalized. \nA reckless driver drives through occasionally, knocking out the hydrants in his path. You must be careful to stay out of his way. \nThe winner is the player with the higher score when the time limit runs out,' or the first player to score 16 points more than his or her opponent. A score board of fire hydrants keeps the score.",

To catch the falling blocks pressing the joustick button raises your arms and you must be in exactly the correct position otherwise another Batty Builder gets squashed. \n \nOnce a block has been caught, Batty Builder carries it to the chosen location and presses the joystick button to launch it into the air - if accurately thrown it will land in the lowest vacant space.

Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs.",

(Unfortunately, you'll have to take our word for it, as the game doesn't make much use of these qualities).\n\nAs in the wacky movie, your goal here is ultimately to overcome a potentially planet-destroying bomb set by the Black Lectroids, inhabitants of Planet 10. Unlike the movie, you don't accomplish this by overcoming the Red Lectroids from the 8th Dimension with the assistance of Team Banzai and the Blue Blaze Irregulars -- instead you wander an eerily depopulated town to procure the necessary components (gasoline, sand, bauxite and \"a special catalyst\") to power up your oscillation overthruster-sporting jet-car and transmit cancellation codes to the bomb. The game uses a simple VERB NOUN text parser and, on some platforms, illustrates the scene with static images.",

A fleet of these large battlecraft are now heading towards your home planet, and it is your job to stop them! The game is played from a side scrolling overhead point of view as your small but agile spaceship flies past the dreadnaughts. On each pass your spaceship makes, you need to try and bomb as many of the energy vents as possible. When all energy vents on a dreadnaught are destroyed, that dreadnaught will explode. Time is limited, though, and if you make too many passes to destroy the energy vents the dreadnaught will be within firing range of your home planet and will destroy it. Each of the dreadnaughts are heavily armed; guns, canons, missiles, and other weapons are located on each dreadnaught and will be trying their best to end your mission. Multiple skill levels are included which alter the number of dreadnaughts you must destroy, as well as their speed and firing capabilities.",

You must then fly it into Soviet airspace in a side-view shoot 'em up section, in which staying low keeps you safe from radars, and quick reactions see you shoot enemy fighters and avoid trees. The next scene takes place on a single-screen view, with five windows to shoot through, and enemies aiming at you to be avoided. You then reach the base, and must shoot out approaching enemies. Finally, you must use discs onto a wall, such that they rebound to hit maintenance robots, with the ultimate goal of causing the base to overheat, the Soviet attack to be thwarted, and the US to be saved.",

You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death. He will also find amulets which make him invulnerable for a short time.

This time it fails to avoid the explosion, just in time to come under fire from two more green alien landers. In a furious firefight he obliterates one on the way down and hits the second as it skims the ground, trying to land. \n \nAnother alien succeeded in landing under the cover of the dogfight, however, and it lies in wait behind one of the lunar ridges, protected from attacks. Nimno is going to have to dodge its ground fire as he fights the two new green aliens filtering down from orbit. Suddenly a red homing suicide ship appears. This turns the situation from bad to desperate. Nimno slows down, firing burst after burst, in a vain hope of destroying the ship before it rams him, but the wildly dodging ship avoids them all. One of the green landers slips too low, and gets hit by a burst meant for the suicide ship. This evens out the odds a bit, but then the grounded lander starts firing from below. \n \nIn a final desperation move, Nimno zooms up to avoid the ground fire, dodges the missiles of the descending lander, hits it with a lucky burst, and zooms down to skim the ground, barely being missed by the homing suicide ship. He is so busy thanking his lucky stars for this narrow escape that he fails to see the approaching lunar mountain in time to react... \n \nThe crater left by the explosion as he crashes into the slope is his final monument. \n \nMoon Patrol is an exciting solitaire or two-player game of fast action and split-second decisions. You can play at four different levels of difficulty. Your mission is to destroy as many as possible of the alien ships without being destroyed yourself. You receive five patrol ships armed with photon torpedoes to help you achieve your mission. If your ship survives one wave of aliens, you must land it to refuel for the next wave, or your craft will run out of fuel and crash.",

Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.",

Exploring this strange world you first come across a dinosaur. Suddenly you realise you are on the planet Guridium ruled by the Connection For Destroying Earth and you remember reading about this is Alien Worlds magazine. The C.F.D.E. has installed a Mutator machine here and transformed all the inhabitants of the planet into flesh eating monsters who now roam the planet as a deterrent to visitors. There are two guards left which you must avoid as you look for the fuel supply. Space Trouble II is a sort of arcade adventure neatly done with a double action joystick control. Pressing the fire button allows you to alternate between controlling the movement of your character and examining and using various objects you find. You need to examine everything carefully and select tools and objects to help you along. There are many puzzles to solve, not least of which is how to get past that dinosaur. Altogether a neat game that will keep you busy for some time.",

Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the \"Tournament\" level).  \nEach resource is required to do certain things on each turn.

There are enemies on the way, such as birds and frogs; Fred can defend himself by tossing rocks that travel in an arc, though ammunition is limited, but Fred can pick up new rocks along the way. Another weapon is the spray can; when found, Fred can spray in front of himself, killing enemies this way. Contact with an enemy or a hazard (such as a cactus) costs a life and sends the player back to the last checkpoint. Weapons can also be used to crack open jugs found along the way. There are pick-ups to find inside, such as rocks, ammunition for the spray can, a cap that protects from a single loss of life, or shields that make Fred immune to all dangers.",

Opening the wrong door or dropping down the wrong hole can easily make the game impossible to complete. There are two energy meters, one representing hunger and one representing thirst. Both of them drop constantly and need to be refilled with the appropriate pickups. Occasionally, small tracked mines will randomly drive onto the screen; colliding with them drains both energy meters quickly. If either energy meter reaches zero, the game is over. The game also ends if the agent walks into a sensor that activates a defense turret; switches can be found which temporarily deactivate sensors when pressed.",

Snarfs are defenseless creatures which will mutate into Snuffers or Diagons after an unpredictable time. The Ripper will follow your Arex's trail while stationary, and will only relent if the player keeps moving. Trying to cross the Ripper's trail will lead to the ship's destruction. \nThe next stage comes if 90% of the level is explored.",

The snakes grow in size as the game goes on and if the player attacks one in the middle it will split and the two halves go in different directions. Like in Pac-Man there are guards, the Serpent Security Force, that are out to get the player. There are three of them roaming the maze and if they make contact with the player a life is lost. There is one way to take out the guards though. If the player eats a snake that a guard is touching, the guard too will get eaten. The game ends when all of the player's three lives are lost.",

The mission will begin when we have obtained more data. \n \nBRIEFING UPDATE: Covert intelligence report a possible weak point has been found. Access to the alien battle station is via a tunnel used to vent any excess energy. Lining the tunnel are defensive positions which may be destroyed. There are also a large number of venting doors. These automatically open and close and cannot be destroyed. They must be avoided. Finally, manteinance and defence drones patrol the ducts watching for faults and space scavengers.
