At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.\n\nSparkster is a rodent carrying a rocket pack on his back. He can move around, duck, jump and hang from branches or rails. His regular attack is a sword slash that sends out a circular projectile. Through the L and R buttons he can dash left and right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack button pressed powers up a rocket meter. When full, different types or actions can be performed: dashing left, right or up to cover a large distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal motion, or a stationary attack.\n\nThe game consists of nine levels of which the last two can only be accessed on higher difficulty levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, defeats all types of robot enemies and collects apples to restore his heart meter near the top of the screen. Most of the game consists of regular platforming gameplay, with a few diversions where Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a top-down view flying in the air like a vertically-scrolling shooter.

Pentaro: the original \"joke character\", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure\n\n5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting \"bunny suit\" who is riding on top of a missile\n\n6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside\n\n7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head\n\n8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters\n\n9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games.

Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat\n\n11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of  Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as \"the flying baby\" of this crazy shooter\n\nIn addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.",

Vic Viper：Gradius 的一艘船\n\n2. Takosuke：前作《Parodius》遊戲中的“章魚”，至少在一部五右衛門中也出現過\n\n3. Twinbee：Twinbee 出現在 Twinbee 橫向捲軸遊戲中，Twinbee 是一個蹲著的圓形機器人，配有噴氣背包和不成比例的大拳擊手套\n\n4. Pentaro：最初的“玩笑角色”，Pentaro 在之前的 Gradius 遊戲中以一隻會飛的企鵝的身份出現。不過，他也在自己的遊戲《科樂美的企鵝冒險》中擔任主角。\n\n5. Hikaru：Hikaru是一個穿著緊身格鬥“兔子服”的女孩，騎在導彈上\n\n6.曼波：曼波是一種看起來很奇怪的魚，頭頂和底下有兩個角\n\n7. 邁克爾：某種胖天使豬。他有翅膀，頭上有金色光環\n\n8. Koitsu：騎在衝浪板上的藍色棍子人。他可能是比較“正常”的角色之一\n\n9. 五右衛門：五右衛門系列遊戲的明星。五右衛門是一名裝備木管的忍者武士。他在《Parodius》中以超人姿勢飛來飛去\n\n10.德古拉：科樂美《德古拉小子》中的明星，這個白髮矮胖的角色保留了他的吸血鬼能力，包括能夠變成蝙蝠的能力\n\n11. Upa：會飛的嬰兒。Upa 實際上來自 Konami 的一款遊戲，名為 Bokutte Upa，但可能只是這款瘋狂射擊遊戲中的“飛翔的嬰兒”更容易被認出\n\n除了你的玩家角色之外，關卡本身也充滿了 Konami 參考、明亮的色彩和簡單滑稽的奇怪組合。例如，你的飛船必須在女人的腿下飛行，或者被巨大的海象追趕，或者讓敵人向你發射可愛的粉紅心形，這種情況並不少見。",

The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map.

    "original_desc": "Bust-A-Move (also known as Puzzle Bobble) is a real-time puzzle game in which the player controls a device called \"pointer\" at the bottom of the screen, aiming and releasing randomly colored bubbles upwards. Depending on the aiming, the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen.\n\nIf the ceiling of the area is covered by too many bubbles, it will gradually descend; the game is over when it nearly reaches the player-controlled pointer. Should the player fail to release the bubbles within a specific time limit, they will be released automatically, unaffected by the pointer's aiming.\n\nA two-player mode is included as well. Each player competes on an area occupying half of the screen, dealing with identically generated bubbles. Whenever a player successfully disposes of a bubble group, a part of it is transferred onto the opponent's part of the screen.\n\nThe game features the two dinosaur protagonists (Bob and Bub) as well as other characters from Bubble Bobble, even though the two games have distinctly different gameplay.",

They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power.

Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.\n\nThat's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named \"inertia.\"  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.\n\nIt may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities, but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an arcade release of this game.\n\n(Now if only someone could explain the \"Camel\" part - referencing the Japanese title.)",

    "original_desc": "The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!\n\nThere are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  Blue Bells are \"big bombs\" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.\n\nThis time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar \"faces\" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:\nVic Viper: The \"gradius ship\" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons\n2. Lord British: The \"other\" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.\n3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles\n4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon\n5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...\n6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.\n7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.\n8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.\n9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an \"upgrade power\" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger\n10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no \"upgrade\" power, using normal options instead\n11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an \"Upgrade Power\" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.\n12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.\n13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his \"upgrade ability\" (Grade Up) to get really powerful\n14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an \"upgrade ability\" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.\n15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.\n16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.",

Mini-games include: Memory; Balls O' Fun\", where you can win items by throwing a ball at them; a mini-game in which you have to stop monkeys from climbing down trees and stealing your items by hitting them with coconuts and others.\n\nIn Cafes you can buy food to replenish your health.\n\nIn stadiums you can participate in special challenges (3D cart races for example), in order to gain new abilities such as double jumps.\n\nWhile stadiums, cafes and amusement parks can be revisited, all other levels only need to be finished once.\n\nFred and Barney are not the only characters that move about the playing field.
