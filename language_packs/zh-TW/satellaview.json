    "original_desc": "BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 is the direct sequel to the original F-Zero game released for the Super Famicom via the Satellaview. Two versions were released - a non-SoundLink game and a SoundLink game. The original non-SoundLink version was released as BSF-Zero 2 Practice on June 1, 1997 (although the title screen remained the same). It contained the four courses first seen throughout BS F-Zero Grand Prix (a Satellaview remake of the original), along with a new course called Mute City IV. Little is known about the later SoundLink version outside of surviving videos, but it was distributed in two halves in August 1997 and had a similar announcer and redone soundtrack as the previous Satellaview entry. At least the first week rearranged a few courses, and replaced two with new locations called \"Forest I\" and \"Forest II\". Presuming no areas were repeated, this likely means the SoundLink version had twice as many courses total. In addition, it can be seen that the player cannot choose between Grand Prix and Practice modes in the SoundLink version; as it was a live broadcast, the player is forced to play each course in a timed Practice mode, and then the Grand Prix race.",
    "desc": "BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 是通過 Satellaview 為 Super Famicom 發布的原版 F-Zero 遊戲的直接續集。發布了兩個版本 - 非 SoundLink 遊戲和 SoundLink 遊戲。最初的非 SoundLink 版本於 1997 年 6 月 1 日作為 BSF-Zero 2 Practice 發布（儘管標題屏幕保持不變）。它包含 BS F-Zero 大獎賽（原版 Satellaview 翻拍版）中首次出現的四個球場，以及名為 Mute City IV 的新球場。除了倖存的視頻之外，我們對後來的 SoundLink 版本知之甚少，但它於 1997 年 8 月分為兩半發行，並且與之前的 Satellaview 條目有類似的播音員和重做的配樂。至少第一周重新安排了一些課程，並用名為“森林 I”和“森林 II”的新地點替換了兩個課程。假設沒有重複的區域，這可能意味著 SoundLink 版本的課程總數是原來的兩倍。另外可以看出，SoundLink版本中玩家無法選擇Grand Prix和Practice模式；由於這是一場現場直播，玩家被迫以定時練習模式參加每個球場，然後參加大獎賽。",

An interesting game for Chrono Trigger/Cross fans, as this was the game that Chrono Cross was essentially a remake of.\n\nGameplay is something between a standard text adventure and a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  Rather than having a full array of possible actions, players are limited to the several options it presents at any time.  With newly discovered items and information, new areas can be reached.  Occasionally battles will occur during the exploration, which are also handled by displaying several possible actions to choose between, such as \"Run\" or \"Jump back as it swings!\"",

Despite the fact that the game would be remade to feature Kirby characters, there are dramatic differences between the two titles, including the overall gameplay concept and levels.

However, despite this, the games still share many similarities, such as graphics and the overall way the player controls the ball.\n\nInterestingly, Special Tee Shot was featured not only in magazines but also on the back of SNES packages as advertisements before ultimately being cancelled and brought back with Kirby characters.

One day, she witnesses a mysterious and brilliant light in the sky to the east. Aginah, the younger brother of the wise man Sahasrahla and now living in his old hideout near the Eastern Palace also witnesses such a light, and travels to investigate. There he finds a strange youth lying on the ground. Zelda, also following the light, meets up with Aginah, and they both carry the child to rest in Sahasrahla's hideout. Confused by the youth's unusual clothes, they believe the child not to hail from Kakariko Village. Speaking to Aginah while the youngster sleeps, Zelda learns that his brother Sahasrahla had also sensed danger surrounding Hyrule and had left the land to find the hero, Link. While Link has not yet returned, Zelda senses that if this new youth was endowed with courage, he or she may be the Hero of Light.Ancient Stone Tablets is different from most other Zelda games as the game's central heroes are actually the avatars of the player's ID for the BS-X Broadcasting System, drawn into Hyrule, which is also true for BS The Legend of Zelda. The difference being that this time the player does not take the place of Link, but takes part in a new tale set after the events of A Link to the Past. The male character wears a green tunic",
