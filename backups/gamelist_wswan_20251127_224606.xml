		<name>Beatmania (Japan)</name>
		<desc>This is a portable version of beatmania and as such it contains everything one could hope for in such a game, a series of music track (with reproduced vocals!), a lot of buttons to press, and a lot of vinyl to scratch.

After you select the music you want to play you'll have a vertical scroll which will indicate when you should hit one of the left directional buttons along with the music. The game also indicates when you should 'scratch' which should be be familiar to anyone who has played a beatmania arcade game. This refers to the scratching of a record, one might think that the WonderSwan is ill-equiped for such a for of input, well think again! beatmania for WonderSwan included in its packaging a miniature record that could be fitted over the right directional keys to  make scratching more realistic.

As you finish songs you'll on lock more difficult and interesting(?) tunes. The game plays vertically.</desc>

		<name>Buffers Evolution (Japan)</name>
		<desc>In a post-apocalyptic future a gambling syndicate seeks to make a quick buck in the gritty remains of earth. By fusing the best of animal and mechanical traits they create three bestial androids from a bird, a lion, and a rhinoceros. Bets are taken and then the robots are loosed into hostile mazes of scrap metal on old earth. Maybe they'll even make it back alive...

The goal of BUFFERS EVOLUTION is to run through a course while collecting ten parts in the best time possible. The courses are large and vary between jungle scenes, deserts, old factories, and general mechanical wastes. These areas are cased in by electricity to stop the contests from escaping and thereby ruining the entertainment of the masses. This will keep you in the bounds of the course. With the press of a button your character will momentarily turn into a 'buffer', a sharp pisiform metallic object, while being a buffer you can destroy enemies by slamming into them, this will often bounce you in a given direction, which is useful for reaching high ledges. 

Although you do not need to get all the parts to clear an area special items can be accrued by collection parts, while on the course proper these parts will heal any damage you may have taken. Perhaps if you collect all the part in all nine areas you'll have the means to escape you captors? 

Gameplay is reminiscent of Sonic the Hedghog
 although in those games you race against a countdown while here you are merely trying to get good times.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the 1996 arcade game, Densha de Go! was one of the first commercial train-driving simulation games, and went on to spawn numerous successors.

The player can choose from a variety of tracks and trains and will then have to drive the train to the designated stations while sticking to the tight schedule, stopping exactly at the marked positions, obeying all signs and signals, and ensuring passenger safety and comfort.

Whenever the player makes a mistake, points are deducted from a counter which at the start of each round is initialized to a value depending on the selected difficulty. If it reaches zero, the game is over.

The following lines are featured:

1. Sagano Main Line (Sanin Line) from Kameoka to Kyoto
2. Keihin-Tohoku Line from Shinagawa to Yokohama
3. Tokaido Main Line (JR Kyoto Line) from Kyoto to Osaka
4. Yamanote Line (Inner Circle) from Shibuya to Tokyo Station

		<name>Digimon Adventure 02: Tag Tamers (Japan)</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the manga series Digimon, in which children can travel to a digital world and help good digital monsters to defeat evil ones. In this game, the two heroes, Ryou and Ken, are summoned to the Digiworld to fight against the archenemy Millenniumon and his side-kick Diablomon. Upon defeating the two evil monsters once again, the heroes realize that Millenniumon has taken a different shape and is reborn to conquer the Digiworld anew. Now you must recruit digital monsters and lead them into the ultimate battle.

The gameplay follows traditional Digimon outlines: you descend into dungeons and have your monster friends fight other monsters in turn-based combat. Upon returning to the town, you can make those monsters participate in future battles. Unlike the two previous Digimon Adventure games,  Anode and  Cathode Tamers, you cannot move over the battle field.</desc>

In this game, the evil Milenniamon has kidnapped several children and is planning to take control over the Digiworld. One of the good monsters, Agumon, escaped, and transported the hero Ryou to the Digiworld. Now Ryou has to fight monsters, capture them, and assemble an army to overthrow Milenniamon and to rescue his friends.

The gameplay involves mainly hunting monsters in dungeons and then sending them to fight other monsters. In the town you can buy supplies and take care of your monsters. The battles are turn-based, and you can move freely over the battle field. Once a contact with an enemy is initiated, an automatic battle sequence follows.</desc>

The story of this game is identical to that of "Anode Tamer", and gameplay mechanics are exactly the same: you descend into dungeons to fight monsters in turn-based style, capture the monsters after the battles and then send them to fight new ones. The difference between the two games are the monsters themselves: "Cathode Tamers" features a brand new set of monsters, and since the beginning of the game you encounter different foes. The full collection of monsters can be achieved only if you complete both games.</desc>

		<desc>The raven has made a friend. But sorrow be to this raven, for this fellow avian migrates, and will not return for seasons. Filled with sadness and regret the raven takes wing. As he soars through his lonely world his tears begin to fall... and water dying flowers. At last he knows what he must do until his friend returns, he will make new friends in the flowers. He will help them grow and spread their seeds. 

Each level in Tane wo Maku Tori contains four pillars bridged by a series of horizontal or vertical rows. These rows are different for each of the three spaces formed by the pillar. The rows may be moved up and down, one set at a time. At the foot of a column, up to three in harder areas, will be a nascent flower. Water drops will fall along the path of the pillars, which will have a different theme for each level, and eventually either fall onto the ground or a flower. Water drops will always move along a bridge if it intersects their path, drops can't go up diagonals. Drops an combine to create larger faster moving drops. Any more than three drops and it will simply fall off the pillar, or bridge, and be of no use.

When a flower gets enough rain drops, or tear drops, it will bloom, when all the flowers on the stage bloom it will be cleared. 

Enemies also roam the stage, gobbling up hydrogen based solution and plants. They follow the same laws as the drops and will move along beams when encountered, however they can go up vertical beams. Should one reach a flower it will nibble at it until dead. This ends the game; however, enemies can be destroyed by three drops combined. 

A time mode is available where the player picks a difficulty level and then plays on the level until a flower is eaten or they run out of time, each completed flower will add to the time. 

A two player mode is available through the Communication Cable

This version presents a number of modes, a track building feature, and only one vehicle; an open-wheel car.

The modes are as follows:

1. World Tour: in the mode the player will compete against five other racers and progress through many tracks located around the world. Although the graphics are not  very descriptive of location, the course's shape and curves will always change.

2. Arcade: in this classic mode you'll race against a single opponent through one of the many global tracks of your choosing.

3. Time Trial: here the player will attempt to make the best time on a course of his choosing. The player is the only car on the track for this mode.

The track editing feature can only be used to make simple tracks at the start of the game; however, playing the World Tour will unlock new track parts based on your performance. Using the communication cable players can transfer tracks between different copies of Final Lap 2000.</desc>

		<name>Fire Pro Wrestling for WonderSwan (Japan)</name>
		<desc>The first North American release of the Fire Pro Wrestling series comes to the Game Boy Advance.

Fire Pro Wrestling has a stacked roster, comprised of many not-quite-copyright-infringing wrestlers like "The Bionic Man" Steve Majors ("Stone Cold" Steve Austin) and Axe Duggan (Hulk Hogan), making WCW vs. WWF vs. ECW matches possible.  The controls are much more than the typical "mash buttons until something happens" that were so popular in earlier wrestling games, instead relying on timing to properly execute a move or hold.</desc>

		<name>Fishing Freaks: BassRise for WonderSwan (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Following in the footsteps of the fishing simulation/rpg Bass Rise this portable remake. Although one can no longer select the gender of  the character there  still remains a great variety of lures and poles to select. As well as five locations. Once a location has been selected a prompt to fill the tacklebox with the lures that and rod that might be most appropriate for the environment. The player then selects where to want to stand on the shore and then the ideal location for a cast.

The view then switches to a closer overhead of the body of water and the player's avatar. A power meter sways over head and should the play manage to stop the meter at just the right point he will be rewarded with his cast going closer to where he intended. Once in the water the player's lure will always be in the center of the screen.

Catching fish is no easy matter as the PlayStation version frequently points out; it is all about finesse. The player will have to entice the fish with wiggles and jolts from the lure... this is of course assuming that the player has selected the right lure. Once a fish is caught a small screen will pop up within the screen, showing a close up of the fish's shadow on the surface of the water. The player will get a chance to see if he hooked something good should the fish jump, as they reel it in.

		<path>./Ganso Jajamaru-kun (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Ganso Jajamaru-kun (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Ganso JaJaMaru-kun is a remake of the NES platformer Ninja JaJaMaru-kun. It includes new levels and bosses that stretch the gameplay in novel ways.

Lord Namazu Dayuu has kidnapped JaJaMaru-kun's beloved Princess Sakura. This piratical lord is no laughing matter, despite his sadistically gleeful disposition, he possess an army of creatures drawn from Japanese folklore to prevent you from reuniting with your princess ever again.

The game is quite simple and plays, for the most part, much like its predecessor. Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick points in that Jajamaru-kun can break by hitting them with his head while, a common trait for arcade heroes. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

Each of these stages has a leader who will posses some special attribute and present a new sprite. After the level in which the leader appears he/she/it will show up in the following levels as a standard level enemy often a bit weaker. Each stage gives you two minutes to complete it, except bosses and special stages. When about one minute remains Lord Namazu will send an orb of fire onto the stage that will slowly home after Jajamaru-kun.

You start the game with two extra lives and three continues. More lives can be found in the game, or by accruing points.  

There are four levels in each game area, village, graveyard, castle and town, seaside and ship, and the hidden island. However it is not enough to kill all the enemies in a stage to progress to the next area. Each level has its a cherry blossom that will descend from the top of the screen at a certain point. If you should kill all the enemies before the blossom arrives or the blossom floats of the bottom of the screen you'll go onto the next level but have to return to get it later, in this case all the enemies will have returned. Collecting all four cherry blossoms will allow you to go onto a special stage and the area boss.

Each game area has one special stage. These stages use the familiar tiers but now they scroll upwards and are littered with traps and hazards; such as, wheels of fire, falling logs, spikes, conveyor belts, etc.. As the scrolling is automatic should Jajamaru-kun not keep up and fall off the bottom of the screen he will die, touching any deadly hazard will also dispatch our hero. Should the player reach the top of the tiers he will be confronted with a gate that his shuriken will open, this leads to a boss.

Each area boss is attacked in a unique boxed in area, sometimes with platforms. The final boss is the only area where Jajamaru-kun may throw his shuriken vertically. There are no power-ups in boss rooms.

The power-ups that can be found in the bricks between tiers wear out after a certain amount of time, with the exception of the frog. They will appear on the upper right hand corner of the screen so you know which ones you've picked up recently, getting the frog clears this list.

1. Invisibility potion: an invisible ninja is an unstoppable ninja. Once a ninja takes the potion you'll become an ninja outline and can go through enemies. Nothing can harm you, but that doesn't limit your ability to dispatch foes.

2. Ninja Cart: this is a small velocoped for ninja, one in this cart you'll be able to kill enemies by barreling into them, even though it doesn't make physical sense you can still jump in this cart.

3. Big Shuriken: this will make your ninja stars about as big as you are, easily defeating evasive enemies

4. Long Distance: this weapon upgrade will make your attacks go across the entire screen.

5. Katana: a fearsome sword, the katana can do away with any foe, regardless of if they have armor or are to low to hit with your normal attack. The katana also destroys incoming projectiles, however, this blade has a very limited range so be careful.

6. Boomerang: causes your shuriken to fly back at you, it wont harm you, but it is great for picking off foes that are weak from behind.

7. Speed increase: this spherical power-up increases Jajamaru-kun speed to the the peril of his enemies, and himself.

8. Watch: this item will give you more time.

9. Extra Ninja: this item will grant you an extra life, very rare! They do not count as a collected item.

10. Inscribed Coin: these coins available in white and black are worth varying amounts of points. They do not count as a collected item.

11. Bombs: these items look like two speed boost orbs, or the wheels of the cart, however, they are a trap. Jumping into these means instant death for Jajamaru-kun

12. Trusty Frog: Jajamaru-kun's noble steed, a humongous man-eating frog. Should you collect four power-ups instead of receiving the power of the fourth you will get to ride on your gigantic frog and eat all the enemies on the stage. This can be dangerous though if you have not yet gotten the stages petal as once on the frog it won't show up. There is no time limit on how long the frog stays, unless of course the time runs out entirely before you gobble up all the enemies. Once a stage ends you will have to repeat the item collection process to ride the frog again. Items in your collection carry over between stages so you can strategically pick a fourth on a stage where you need the frog.</desc>

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

		<name>Meitantei Conan: Majutsushi no Chsenj! (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Conan Edogawa is the pseudonym of Shin'ichi Kudo, but more than just a pseudonym, a pseudoform. Shin'ichi Kudo, an inquisitive seventeen year old student, was investigating a blackmail case when attacked by members of the Black Organization. He was forced to take an experimental APTX 4869 drug which caused, in a rare side-effect, his body to transform into that of a seven-year-old. 

This does not stop Shin'ichi, adopting the name Conan Edogawa he moves in with Ran Mori, his childhood friend and sweetheart. Enrolling in a elementary school to complete his disguise he vows to find out who is backing the Black Organization, and to have his revenge. With the help of his his oddball classmates, an ex-member of the Black Organization Ai Haibara, whose also been turned into a child, and his beloved he just might do it...

The games story follows the Conan through his school life which intertwines with his search for justice. He forms a Junior Detective League in his school to help him out. This cast of characters will help supply you information throughout the game.

The gameplay consists of using a map screen to travel to a number of areas collecting clues for the case you are on. Each area offers you the ability to examine the area, talk to bystanders, collect items, and sometimes attack if a threat is apparent. 

After collecting information you will have the chance to open your notebook, which will cause the WonderSwan to switch to a vertical orientation, and review your information. Also in the note books is a logic grid. On the grid you will have to select where you've deduced something intersects,who was at the scene at what time, by marking it with a circle and voiding all impossibilities with crosses. Once you've completed an entire grid you'll be able to present your deductions or press a point further allowing you to progress. If you've gotten your reasoning wrong, however, it is back to the drawing board and time to recheck you evidence and maybe time to see if you missed some clues.

This game includes five scenarios, roughly translated to English as:

1. Continuous high school girl kidnapping
2. Murder on the suspense drama set
3. Jack the Ripper murder
 
The mysteries incident's letter of notice
4. Treasure cases at the end of the century</desc>

		<desc>Detective Conan returns to the WonderSwans continuing his efforts to thwart the dreaded Black Organization. The game features new mysteries and new characters from the Conan universe. 

New features include finding keys. Keys represent actual bits of evidence you can use to solve the logic puzzles in the game once you find all the keys you will be able to attempt to solve the puzzle. However, often in the search for keys one finds hints. Hints are bits of information that will point you in the right direction of a key. Hints also be presented, singularly or combined, to various people in an attempt to extract information, or keys. Once you have all the keys you will be able to have an entire logic grid, otherwise there will be grayed out areas on the grid.

There is also now a mode in some cases where Conan will have to chase the suspect through several areas before subduing him. 

The game records your information at the start of the game to work a character based off of you into the game. This character can be swapped with other owners of 
Meitantei Conan: Nishi no Meitantei Saidai no Kiki !? through the Communication Cable.

This game alternates between horizontal display for regular play and investigation, and vertical display for Conan's detective notebook.</desc>

		<name>Mingle Magnet (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Mingle Magnet is a simple puzzle game of the falling block variety. The player oversees a 10 x 10 square field where the first four rows (three on easy) have been filled by blocks. Each block shows one of three symbols, a dark gray circle, a light gray circle, and a white circle. When ever any of blocks with matching symbols touch they will form a link. By moving the cursor over a chain and clicking on it the player will be given points based on its size on the chain will be removed. The goal is to get a large score while making sure that new pieces can still enter the field. Once no more pieces can enter the game ends. Blocks fall at the same time one square apart, when the next set of blocks fall they will occupy the space given by the previous drop.

The "magnet" aspect of Mingle Magnet come into play in how the player can control the placement of the blocks. All the blocks are attracted to a magnet which, although not seen, can be placed on any side of the field. All blocks will be drawn to the magnet. For example, if one has the magnet at the south of the field and then puts it to the north what was the top of the block pile will now be the bottom, and blocks will fall onto what was the bottom. The direction of the magnet is indicated by a magnetic field animation behind the action.

		<name>Nice On (Japan)</name>
		<desc>A simple golf game; Nice On brings the gray-gradient green into the hands itinerant gamers. 

The mechanism for golfing in this game is simple as it is classic. The players chibi avatar stands by the tee club aloft whilst a 'power bar' fluctuates up and down beside it. When the player presses a button the power bars movements will stop and how height the bar was will effect the distance of the shot. Before this the player may of course state the direction they'd like to hit the ball and where on it's surface they would like to strike it. Hazards are or course a threat to the novice, such as sand traps, meddlesome trees, etc. The flight of the ball is shown in an overhead view.

Once the ball is on the putting green the view remains over head regardless if the ball is in motion or being struck. The player may here select the direction of the strike to the ball, and the power bar will recommence it's spasms; however, the golfer ball will move of its own accord without any golfer in sight. The putting green is covered by marks that indicate the subtle slopping of the ground that seeks to keep you away from your triple bogey. 

Should you find endlessly teeing off with yourself a bit tedious you may use the Communication Cable to play with another human, or you may challenge the npc character. This veritable samurai of the rough, swarthily attired in a fly fishing hat, will critique your game as he putts against you.</desc>

A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; "5 9 4" would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. 

Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</desc>

		<name>Pocket Fighter (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Pocket Fighter is a crossover fighting game that takes characters from the Street Fighter, Darkstalkers, and Red Earth fighting series, and presents them in a cute shrunken chibi form with ridiculous moves and costumes. The games fights take place in various Capcom locations.

At the top of the screen is your, and your opponents, health bar. Below that is a meter showing how many gems you've collected. Gems are produced from a character when they are hit by a kick or a punch, these gems will then lie on the ground until someone picks them up. Filling up your gem gauge will increase your special attack meters on the bottom of the screen. Ideally one aims to achieve a special attack level of 9 by picking up gems, however, battle will often having you using these up before you reach that lofty number.

The main difference between the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version of Pocket Fighter is a card battle mode. 

In the card battle mode you will be presented with a set of three to six cards to choose from to form an attack, after which you'll view the combat and get new cards to pick from until one player is K.O.'ed

The cards will have a attack power and a defense power. By combing cards you'll get an attack, defense, and counter value
which determine an overall power value. The player who has selected the higher power value will attack that turn, unless your foe has picked a guard card, an evasion card, or a high enough counter value. Other cards include recovery cards and special move cards.

"Collectible Cards", cards featuring various graphics of the game's characters, can be obtained by playing the games various modes, such as "Arcade", and traded via the Communication Cable

The game also featured an online high score board through the WonderGate.</desc>

		<desc>A spin-off of the Rainbow Islands games, this title features Putty instead of the classic Bub &amp; Bob. Like the previous games set on the island the character's main tools and weapons are rainbows. These rainbows can be walked on to scale heights or cover gaps. Rainbows can also be used to kill enemies by striking them with the arc as it is created, or after it has taken form jumping on it so that it breaks and the shards rain death on those below. Enemies can also be trapped in rainbows. Enemies killed by rainbow shards will sometimes drop a special item or a gem. A series of gems are needed to properly clear each level.

The goal of each area, aside from collecting gems, is to scale to the top of the island. Islands are made out of a series of themed platforms covered with associated enemies. These areas are scattered with items, mostly food, that will increase your score. Sometimes a rainbow will dislodge hidden food or an enemy will drop some when killed. If your score is high enough you will start to  send out more than one rainbow at a time. At the end of each island there will be a boss. If you fulfilled certain requirements in the level you may get a special item.

The islands in this game are, here listed with their theme:

1. Insect Island: Insects and nature
2. Monster Island: Classic horror monsters
3. Doh Island: Geometric
4. Darius Island: Machines

The curse of the "Ring" that has infected novels, movies, TV dramas and all kinds of media has finally involved Wonder Swan! 
The first "TERRORS" that was popular as a novel theater. The characteristic of "Ring ∞" is that the power of "TERRORS" is greatly improved in the quality of graphics and sound. In addition, the text is a little larger than "TERRORS", so the readability of the text is considerably improved. In terms of systems, more thrilling improvements have been made, such as the addition of "normal branch" and "branch by teller points" and "branch by time". 
The player becomes the main character who has watched Sadako's video and advances the game. Naturally, the scenario uses a multi-ending style, so even if you can survive and finish the scenario safely, it is not the end of the game. From there, a new "Ring" story begins. Then, as I play a number of scenarios, the truth gradually becomes clear... 
This software supports Wonder Gate, so if you download new data using Wonder Gate, you can enjoy additional scenarios from the perspective of the hero's best friend.</desc>

		<desc>This is a portable edition of the solitaire game Shanghai, the game uses traditional Mah Jong tiles. The aim of the game is to match tiles, four of each type will be put on the playing field, when two tiles are matched they are removed when none remain you win. Only tiles that can be moved freely to the left or right may be matched. A wrong move may result in you not being able to clear the field. 

A slight story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that needs it power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve of these stages there by restoring the animals power. 

Some variants are also included:

1. Kong Kong: Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you go slowly you will have tiles sent over to your by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop. Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer.

2. Challenge (WonderSwan only): A large Shanghai game that you'll try to race through to get the best score. 

3. Goldrush: In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked 'G'. G is for GOLD, boy! So get cracking.</desc>

		<desc>Straight from the National Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) come the greatest wrestlers of the Land of the Rising Sun; beware the Thunder Lyger!

Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling Toukon Retsuden is a simple wrestling game where the player takes control of one of six wrestlers, who were current figures at the time of the games publication. Random battles can be arranged or competition in a tournament against all the games wrestlers.

A player controls their wrestler with the directional X buttons and the A &amp; B buttons. A &amp; B perform punches and kicks, in close enough a punch can perform a grab. Once a wrestler is locked in a grab they can be tossed according to the directional buttons. The more abuse a character take the longer it will take them to stand up, this makes them very agreeable to kick or jump upon. 

By punching a fallen gladiator you will get him in a lock. When done closer to the injured legs you will usually try to bend them and when done closer to his head you will crush his cranium between your mighty thighs. If you can do this for ten seconds without him breaking free, your chosen wrestler will win.</desc>

		<name>Slither Link (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Slither Link is a fiendishly simple puzzle game from the pages of the Nikoli puzzle magazine. While Nikoli is widely known for coining the puzzle name Sudoku they also have produced a myriad of puzzles often dealing with numbers. 

In this puzzle the player needs to create a loop around the fields grid with out having the loop's line cross itself. This would of course present little challenge if it weren't for those pesky numbers. The field is dotted with numerals that signal how many times the line may be next to it. The number one may only have the line contiguous with it on one side, the two two sides, the three three side. Four of course does not exist as that would, by a requirement to have four sides, create a square and thus a intersection of the line. Zeros also exist these may not have any lines bordering them at all. 

When a loop has been created so that all numbers are 'touched' appropriately and the line make a full loop you've cleared the puzzle. The game possesses six levels of difficulty and is played vertically on the WonderSwan.</desc>

The player controls a single one of their chosen team's members. The AI clumsily takes care of the rest. The player's selected splinter of the team avatar will move in the direction the player presses while dribbling the ball, should it be in his possession. When a button is pressed the ball will be kicked, should fortune spare your 2.49 inch screen a glance, to another player on your team. If another team member gets the ball you will automatically switch to that player. Kicking the ball is achieved by pressing a button which will more likely cause the player's character to fall on his face.

A penalty shot mini-game is included where the view shifts to behind the player making the shot.</desc>

Using the WonderSwan's internal memory, players can send their clear data to each successive game; several events are altered based on the player's previous save, gained items are carried over to Part 3, and a special final scenario can be unlocked by clearing the entire trilogy within 777 turns. The game, like its predecessor, borrows almost all of its gameplay mechanics from F/F Final; however, it introduces the "Support System" which immediately became a core mechanic of the SRW franchise. In Part 2, Excellen Browning and the Londo Bell forces fend off enemies in outer space.</desc>

Each panda wears headgear associated with its homeland, top hat for Britain, turban for India, etc. When our hero is about to reach the new lazy panda something gets in the way, usually an incline too large to roll over. By finishing a certain number of lines you'll give your stymied panda the energy to jump the obstacle.

		<path>./Tekken Card Challenge (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Tekken Card Challenge (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Fighting games are generally interested in making a player hit a complex mash of buttons to perform pugilistic wonders. This game is however card based, how can that work? During a battle between two opponents a set of five moves will appear on a roulette. The player hits a button to stop the rotation of the selector to semi-randomly select a field. A higher number card will always cancels out a lower number card. Higher number cards also do more damage. Block cards and counter cards also exist.

A number of different attacks are available: combo cards pile up, allowing multiple cards to be selected until a combo card is reselected or a non-combo card is selected; juggling cards which allow for classic fighting game mechanics by allowing another attack after the first; charge cards allow the player to wait a turn to do extra damage should the player use an attack the next turn.

All cards have different visuals, and oft times different names, for different characters. 

There are several game modes: a classic arcade battle where the player selects a character and a computer controlled character to face; an adventure mode where the player finds new cards and unlocks new character by defeating them; and a multiplayer vs. match for WonderSwan wielding humans.

The story mode plays on a 15x15 grid map covered with shrines, villages, and impassible mountains. You will only have a certain number of steps to make it to stage exit or you'll lose. Of course this Harshadic field is populated with a grave propensity of villains. Roving in the dark, for all the area of the world is obscured by 'fog' until the player walks there, are mysterious stormtroopers called Crow, Owl, Eagle. Also wandering the land are Tekken characters who hold long standing grudges against the player's character. Above it all in a high tower is the heinous Ogre, can he be defeated? 

Along the way cards can be found that will increase the amount of moves that can be performed in combat. Sacred ziggurats exist, two per map, that will heal wounds and, if enough enemies have been defeated since the last shrine, a new form of attack card be obtained. These shrines may not be reentered. 

Players may fight their friends or foes using the Communication Cable to connect two WonderSwans for a fight.</desc>

		<desc>Umitsuri ni Ikou! is a simple fishing simulator where you control a little boy at a variety of seaside locations; a pier, a beach, a stone outcropping, and out on the ocean.

As you cast a bar will rise and fall on the right side of the screen, when you press the A button the the bar will stop. Depending on how high the bar is when you stop it correlates to how far your line goes. Bigger fish lurk farther out; however, bigger fish are more difficult to real in given their distance from shore.

One your hook is in the water you will be treated to a [fisheye?] view of it in the brine. The background water is represented in different gradients so that the player can tell if they are moving up and down. A meter on the right hand side of the screen shows how deep you are, the farther you cast the deeper you'll be. 

By pulling the line up with fish will be attracted to the hook. Should one grab on you'll get a "HIT". The view will now revert to being behind the fisher. Based on indications from a bar on the bottom you will have to push left and right, based on how the fish is trying to escape while pressing A. 

Once caught you'll learn how big your fish was and be able to exchange data about it with other WonderSwan players.</desc>

		<desc>Vaitz Blade is an RPG set in a medieval European-style world, where you collect monsters by lowering their hitpoints. You can also fuse two monsters to create a stronger one. The game has 200 collectible species. The main point of this game is the "Vaitz" in the title. It is a generic term for monsters, and there are more than 180 different types of Vaitz in total in "Vaitz Blade". And it's not just monsters that can be combined with each other, but also items that can be combined with each other in this game. The variety of battles is one of the game's charms. In addition to the normal battles in which the player makes full use of the weapons and items he/she has created, the game also includes events and special battles in the arena (one-on-one combat, tag team matches, team battles, winner-take-all battles and time attacks) that add to the excitement of the game. There are also plenty of events during the story, such as a vertical shooting game that takes advantage of the unique characteristics of WonderSwan.</desc>

		<path>./Wonder Stadium (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Wonder Stadium (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Wonder Stadium, not to be confused with the near identical Wonder Stadium '99, presents a monochrome baseball experience for the WonderSwan. Players will quickly be able to start playing as one of fourteen teams, twelve professional two fictional, in All-Star Duel, Exhibition Game, or Homerun Competition modes. Player can also personalize their teams by giving the generic characters who comprise the teams names. 

When starting a game you'll be asked to select a team, a stadium; classic, seaside, or space, and how many innings the game will run from 1 to 9.

Hitting the ball is the 'simple' affair that it usually is, time your swing and if you timed well your ball will fly into or out of the field. Wonder Stadium does give the ability to bunt and tweak the direction that bunt will go. 

While playing the field you'll have considerable command over a number of different pitches. From moving your pitchers subtly around the mound to how hard a throw you'll give. Once your opposing team manages to get a hit the game stops giving you the view from behind the plate a switches to a birds-eye view of the field.

Each ballplayer is hooked to another for instance when you move your man on first base the fellow in the field behind him will move in the same way, a bit clumsy but an acceptable compromise. The person nearest the ball will always be under your control. Once you get the ball you may throw it toward a base of your choice.</desc>

		<name>wuzb? Produce: Street Dancer (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Street Dancer is a rhythm game starring the crew of wuz?b? a Japanese pop music performance group. 

The game features standard with a line of button prompts scrolling across the bottom of the play are that you will have to press when they reach the center of the screen. Before you start a game you will be asked to select a member of the wuz?b? crew; Nana, Kaoru, Shino, or U. As you press buttons the chosen terpsichorean will shake it or stare at you in stupefaction, depending on your performance. A 'life bar' is presented on the screen if you fail to perform well the bar will go down, when it is empty your game ends. To clear a stage and unlock a new background with a harder song you'll have to get about a 60% perfect score. You can always record your performances to watch over and over.

When a stage is clear you unlock new dance moves, these dance moves will appear in the game and in the "Step Book". In the step book you can watch the members of wuz?b? perform all their signature moves. You can also have the dancers perform in any way you like which you can record and repay for your friends. 

Three different musical styles are represented: jazz, hip hop, and rock. The game makes each of these modes unique, not just by changing musical tone but, by having the player change the way he holds the WonderSwan for each genre.

The forms are:

1. Hip hop: the screen is held in the normal horizontal position so that the left hand can hit the A+B buttons and right hand can press the basic directional keys.

2. Lockin' [sic]: In the mode the system is held so that both hands can press the directional buttons.This mode also requires you to press two notes at a time usually matching directions on both sets of directional buttons.

3. Jazz: This is a total reversal of the hip hop mode. The system will now be horizontal but essentially upside down. Now the directional keys and A+B buttons will be at the top of the console

A multiplayer mode is also included for two people on one system. both players take one set of the WonderSwans directional buttons and both players select different dancers. The multiplayer mode takes place in the vertical "lockin'" style, with two columns of press commands scrolling on the right. Both players are instructed by one of the columns, the player that is doing better will have their chosen dancer displayed on the screen.</desc>
