		<name>Phantasy Star Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Long ago, the evil Cablon ravaged the Copto planet, a light year away of the Algol system. When he was defeated, he was sealed on a planet discovered by Alis, the heroine of the first "Phantasy Star", a planet that was also known as Alisland. In this gaiden (side-story) set in Phantasy Star universe, you play the role of two young people from the village Tedo - Alec and Mina. One day, Mina finds an old artifact. While wondering what that could be, the young people learn that Alec' father was attacked and kidnapped by bandits. Determined to find him, the two heroes embark on a dangerous journey that will eventually lead them much further than they suspect. 

Phantasy Star Gaiden plays pretty much like any other Phantasy Star starting with the second game: both towns and dungeons are in top-down view, the turn-based battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay is standard console-style RPG: you should fight random enemies, gain experience and gold, buy better equipment, visit many towns and dungeons, etc.</desc>

		<name>Super Columns</name>
		<desc>Super Columns is an updated version of Columns with more options of play, but with the same setup, maneuvering falling blocks into groups of three or more to eliminate them from the screen.  Along with a Versus mode there is also a Story mode as well.

An evil sorcerer by the name of Surhand has stolen a mystical amulet which brings peace and serenity to the land of Phoenicia and hopes to use it to bring death and destruction to the land.  The player must battle their way through his four guards in a series of best two-out-of-three games of Columns in order to face off against Surhand and bring peace back to the land.

The Flash Mode also returns to this version as well as the new Endless Mode where the main objective is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  There are also special columns throughout these modes such as Glitter Columns which eliminates all blocks of the same color on the screen at once as well as Stone Block Columns which can only be eliminated through magic power-ups that can be obtained by eliminating the base blocks.</desc>

		<name>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</name>
		<desc>Coming back from the vacation Sonic took after foiling the plans of Dr Robotnik, he finds that Tails and all his other animal friends are missing. Sonic finds a letter waiting for him, that reads:

"Dear Sonic,

Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and bring the six Chaos Emeralds.

Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!

Sincerely, Tails."

That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat Robotnik again.

The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis. Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.</desc>

		<path>./Shining Force Gaiden - Final Conflict (Japan) (Translated).zip</path>
		<name>Shining Force Gaiden : Final Conflict</name>
		<desc>One of the three gaiden (side-story) Shining Force games for GameGear. The events of the game take place in a time period between the first and the second mainstream Shining Force games. After Max, the leader of the first Shining Force, defeated the Dark Dragon, peace was restored to the world. However, the sorceress Mishaela took control over the forces of evil. Pursuing her, Max' comrades got injured and were forced to quit. Upon returning back to their hometown, they found out Mishaela has already taken the Elder hostage. Lead by the young warrior Ian, the Force has to find Max and to defeat Mishaela.

The game is a strategy RPG with gameplay similar to other Shining Force games. You control a large party of warriors (you can choose the characters yourself from many available). The game consists mainly of large strategic turn-based battles, in which you navigate your characters around and attack the enemies physically, or cast area-based spells.</desc>

		<name>Sonic the Hedgehog : Triple Trouble</name>
		<desc>Dr. Robotnik has stolen all the Chaos Emeralds, yet again, but when the experiment for his new weapon goes wrong, the Emeralds get scattered across the island. While Sonic &amp; Tails are out searching for them, Robotnik finds the yellow emerald and convinces Knuckles the Echidna that Sonic wants to steal all the other Emeralds. While all this is happening, Nack the Weasel seizes his chance to take the emeralds for himself while everyone else is pre-occupied. Now it's a 4-way race to retrieve the emeralds.

The gameplay is like the other Sonic titles, but this is only available on the Game Gear. The player can choose to play as Sonic or Tails (who can fly), and you're trying to reach the Chaos Emeralds before anyone else. A change from other Sonic games is that when hit, all rings are not lost, only a set amount (30–50 depending on the level) is lost.</desc>

		<desc>Once upon a mouse, there was a kingdom that was ruled by the selfish king Pete. One day, a terrible shadow crept over the kingdom, threatening the lives of its inhabitants. The king's adviser said the only way to stop the shadow would be for the king himself to travel out and to seek the cure. But the cowardly king Pete preferred to stay in the castle, and sent a simple laundry boy named Mickey instead! 

As Mickey Mouse, you will travel through various levels in this platform game. Mickey shoots an unlimited amount of little balls on the enemies, can jump, climb on stairs, hang on ropes, and perform other tricks. Mickey can also pick up items and put them in another place, for example to access a higher level or to break a treasure chest open.</desc>

		<name>Streets of Rage 2</name>
		<desc>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>

		<name>Phantasy Star Adventure</name>
		<desc>You are an agent of Paseo on Motavia. One day, in December 1268 A.W, you received a letter at base. The sender was Ken Miller. He was a scientist as well as an old friend of yours. He had immigrated to Dezolis to conduct his research years ago.  These were the contents of the letter: "How are you?  I have succeeded in the discovery of the century. You must come and see it."

You travel to the planet Dezolis and visit a town called Carsonville. There, you find out that Dr. Miller has invented a machine that can make human beings immensely powerful. The problem is, Dr. Miller is kidnapped, along with his invention. With the help of his sister Laila you have to solve this mystery.

This game is a Japanese-style adventure game set in the Phantasy Star universe. You interact with the game world by choosing available options such as "See", "Talk", "Move", etc. There are a few puzzles to solve, but the largest part of the game is dedicated to exploration and dialogue with the characters.</desc>

The Game Gear version of Mega Man is an original game created by developer Freestyle, using Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5 for the NES as its basis.  Mega Man is able to perform his slide that was introduced in Mega Man 3, as well as call his dog, Rush, for assistance.  He can also charge up his buster for a more powerful shot.

Players can initially select any stage from a choice of four: Stone Man, Napalm Man, Bright Man and Star Man.  After defeating these four bosses, players progress to Dr. Cossack's fortress, which contains Wave Man and Toad Man as its bosses.  After they are defeated, it's off to the final confrontation with Dr. Wily himself.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic Drift 2 is the sequel to Sonic Drift, also on the Game Gear and the first in the series to be released outside Japan. One of the new things in the sequel is a lag boost system, which means that anyone who is behind gets a boost to catch up again. This keeps the action in the game. Another new thing is that the gadgets touched while racing do not come into effect immediately. They need to be triggered manually by pressing up on the D-pad.

There are 3 GPs to compete in and each GP has 6 tracks. The names of the GPs are:

1. Purple Chaos GP
2. White Chaos GP
3. Blue Chaos GP

Racing skills can be improved in the Free Run mode on any of the tracks, or, with a Gear-to-Gear cable and a spare copy of the game, direct competition against another human player in the versus mode.</desc>

		<desc>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.

Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).

The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</desc>

As usual, your task is to exterminate level upon level of nasties with your space ship. The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.</desc>

		<name>Tails Adventures</name>
		<desc>Before Tails met Sonic the Hedgehog he lived on Cocoa Island, a place that isn't on the map. It's an island pulled up by the Chaos Emeralds. Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it's coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it's power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.

Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Warriors</name>
		<desc>The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.

Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.
In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.</desc>

		<name>Arena : Maze of Death</name>
		<desc>In the year 2026, a corrupt government has used a television broadcasting company called Astralnet Broadcasting Company to secretly control the population and keep them brainwashed.  During these times a group of pro-democratic rebels, led by Guy Freelander, has obtained a secret taped meeting between top government officials and ABC directors discussing their diabolical plans.  Convinced that if they play the tape through ABC's broadcasting, they can convince the repressed population to rise up against the current regime.  The only problem that stands in their way is the way to the broadcasting center, a death trap nicknamed the maze.

The player takes control of Guy Freelander and must transverse this maze, with 20 levels and 100 different rooms in total, using a standard gun and a knife to take out security guards, androids, mutants and must avoid various pitfalls and traps scattered in these rooms.  The view of the game is isometric and has a password feature to allow players to pick up and return to the previous room they were in without having to replay the previous levels.  There are no life bars, instead the player can take four hits before their character dies with five lives.  After losing these five lives, the game will be over.</desc>

There are also hazards to avoid, like red spikes and enemies.

Breaking blocks is the most important gameplay element. Breaking a block causes the column of blocks above it to fall one place down. The player must use this block breaking ability to change the labyrinth and create a way to the princess. 

The short introduction sequence shows the back story: A beautiful princess fell in love with you! And you fell in love with her too... The wizard of forest "Popil" shut her in his labyrinth. Please save her!</desc>

		<name>Sonic the Hedgehog</name>
		<desc>SEGA's mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut in a famous Genesis title, but Sega's 8-bit systems got their own version of the platformer, featuring the same story and gameplay style, but different levels. To stop the evil Dr. Robotnik, Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new. Enemies and power-ups are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.</desc>

		<desc>Mister Greede, a corrupt tycoon and factory owner, deprives the local citizens of the goods they need and deserve. That’s why you have infiltrated his factory. Now you must manipulate the conveyor belts skillfully to deliver the correct product to the right person waiting outside, but you have only a limited amount of time. Unfortunately, thugs with bats or even guns patrol the factory. Your only weapon against these security guards is a battle cry that temporarily stuns them, but not for too long.

Factory Panic consists of four rounds, and each round consists of eight stages. Before a stage starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. Rounds one and three are played in “Switch Mode”: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in “Bridge Mode”: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.

If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight that can be placed on a switch.</desc>

		<name>Defenders of Oasis</name>
		<desc>A long, long time ago, the legendary king Jamseed defeated the evil Ahriman, the spirit of darkness. But just before, Ahriman managed to send into the world his most horrifying servant: the dragon Zahhark. Years have passed, Zahhark was defeated by the descendants of Jamseed, but its own descendants continued menacing the kingdom of Shanadar. Many generations later, you, the young Prince of Shanadar, has to confront the evil. Zahhark's offsprings plan to destroy the kingdom, and the Prince must first seek aid in a neighboring country, accompanied by a beautiful Princess, by the Genie from a lamp, and other friends.

This is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. You control the Prince and his party members, visiting various locations, buying and finding items, and fighting random enemies and bosses in a turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective.</desc>

		<path>./Panzer Dragoon Mini (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Panzer Dragoon Mini</name>
		<desc>Panzer Dragoon Mini is the Japan-only 8-bit version of Sega's popular 32-bit rail shooter, but due to (massive) hardware limitations, the game has more in common with other classic Sega game, Space Harrier. Taking further away from the original games, there is no rider and the game lacks any plotline.
The player starts by choosing one of three dragons, and from there must shoot at incoming enemies (although for most time, just avoiding incoming fire is an easier way to progress in the game). At the end of the level (each with two bosses), a password appears and allows the game to be resumed later.</desc>
