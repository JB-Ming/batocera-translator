		<name>Motoracer Advance</name>
		<desc>The player controls a motorcyclist and must try to win races on various terrain and settings. Each motorcycle in the game handles differently with some performing better on paved roads and others working better on rougher terrain.[1]

There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of "powersliding" on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.</desc>

		<desc>You are an allied fighter pilot in WW1, duking it out with the "Huns" up in the sky in over 200 missions.

The missions usually come in three flavors: Top-down view bombing missions where you have to take out strategically important targets, isometric strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head.

The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a page of our character's new entry for the diary-like journal in his company between every mission.</desc>

		<name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</name>
		<desc>The Tony Hawk skateboarding series makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with this adaptation of the second Pro Skater game.

Gameplay is similar to the original console game. The levels have been adapted from the console version for the two dimensional isometric perspective; one is even taken from the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

In Career Mode, choose from one of 13 professional skaters and, in each level, complete various goals like collecting items, performing special tricks and of course breaking high scores by performing tricks and combos. Completing the goals earns money which unlocks new levels and can be spent on new boards, tricks and upgrading your skater's stats. In competition levels, you don't skate for money but compete for a medal.

In the Free Skate and Single Session modes, unlocked levels can be practiced and new high scores be established.</desc>

		<path>./Dynasty Warriors Advance (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Dynasty Warriors Advance</name>
		<desc>Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Based on the "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient China,  it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying to become the dominant power.

Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the "board". If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units. The player's success against the enemy unit will determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed completely if all of it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.</desc>

The legendary heroes of the Reploids, X and Zero, defeated the evil Sigma long ago, and a new army was created to prevent outbreaks of the Maverick Virus. But as time went on, the army became oppressive, and began to deal out a paranoid brand of justice. It is said that their leader, once a great warrior, has become cold and calculating, eliminating any Reploid that dares oppose him.

A hero is needed in these dark times, and that is exactly what Ciel and her rebel group have found in an old ruin...a hero from the past, reborn in the future.

Zero has come into a time he does not know, to save it from a figure of the past...the fate of freedom rests on his shoulders.</desc>

		<desc>Magical Vacation is one of the Game Boy Advance's earliest RPGs and it was also Brownie Brown's very first game after they completed Legend of Mana and left Squaresoft. Magical Vacation is a prequel of sorts to the Nintendo DS game "Magical Starsign."

Brownie Brown would later go on to do Sword of Mana and Mother 3 on the GBA. The game never saw an overseas release and is one of the few gems on the Game Boy Advance that is Japanese exclusive.</desc>

		<name>Fire Emblem : Fuuin no Tsurugi</name>
		<desc>Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi is the sixth entry in the Fire Emblem series, the first title produced for the system, and the first title to appear on a handheld console. It is a turn-based tactical role-playing game in which players move a small group of units around a square-based grid, battling their enemies in order to complete a certain predefined objective. It is reminiscent of other tactical RPGs with features such as character classes and the ability to level up.

The Binding Blade is set on the fictional continent of Elibe, which has been dominated by humans for centuries following an ancient war between humanity and dragons. The story follows Roy, a young nobleman from the small independent nation of Pherae as he leads a growing army against the forces of King Zephiel of the kingdom of Bern, who is gradually taking over Elibe with the aid of a mysterious power.</desc>

		<desc>Ruled by a royal family said to be descendants of the gods themselves, Fantasinia is a prosperous and peaceful land -- until the peace is shattered by the invading forces of the Empire of Bronkia. Led by the young emperor Gulcasa, who seized control of the Empire in a brutal coup d?etat, Bronchia's Imperial Army cuts a bloody swath through the people of Fantasinia and the Royal Armies of King Ordeene. Amidst the chaos, a young woman escapes from the besieged capital of Partina -- a woman with innocence in her face, and a sword in her hand. The girl?s name is Princess Yggdra, the last surviving member of the royal family; the sword is the Gran Centurio, a legendary blade once wielded by the founder of Fantasinia, and passed down through generations of royalty. Fleeing to to a remote valley at the southern tip of the continent, Yggdra meets up with Milanor, the charismatic leader of a band of thieves, and readies herself for a war of liberation.</desc>

To fix the problem, Zero must battle through level after level, using the new Chain Rod weapon to grapple onto ledges to gain an advantage in collecting out of reach items or attacking enemies from above. Cyber Elfs can again be collected to gain some helpful powerups.

New to the series is a two player challenge mode, where the first to complete the level wins.</desc>

		<desc>It has been some twelve years since the destruction of Kilrah, the Kilrathi homeworld. The Terran Confederation, slowly demobilizing and reorganizing its military assets, has settled on a new strategy: building several Midway-class megacarriers, brainchild of Navy Commodore Christopher Blair. These new carriers, over a kilometer long, carry all the hardware and weaponry of a Kilrathi-War-era carrier battle group. The first one, the Midway herself, is undergoing her shakedown cruise, with Blair along for the ride. Before this, though, the player is treated to a CGI video of a bizarre rupture in space in the Kilrah system: the first of the Nephilim invaders. The game's titular prophecy involves the coming of these alien invaders, who shall arrive only after "one who has the heart of a Kilrathi, but who is not Kilrathi-born," conquers the felinoid warrior race.</desc>

		<name>Mother 3</name>
		<desc>The Nowhere Islands are an idyllic place; the residents of Tazmily Village live peacefully and in harmony with nature and with each other. But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare.

Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to "dash", which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way (or to ram some objects/characters).

There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based and feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have "rolling HP meters"; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly.</desc>

The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher. The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!

Players fight through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style. Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money and weaponry. Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes. After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount, you can level up the turtles.

Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai. These weapons are used in their standard attacks. A basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button. Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.</desc>

		<desc>The game continues the tradition of Tengai Makyou series, also known as "Far East of Eden". You play as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries.

The most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.</desc>

		<desc>This is the standard "Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue her" story. In this case, the Princess is transformed into a ball and launched from a Super Mario 64-style cannon, which a pair of goombas aim directly at Bowser's Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and chases after her.

There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of pinball tables. Each table has some exits (including the one below the flippers) that Mario can use to move to other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also features a "Time Attack" mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.</desc>

The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair.

And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</desc>

Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more. At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' - in this stage, sections of the previously played stages are combined and thrown at you at random, all while a single song plays.</desc>

		<name>Mega Man Zero 3</name>
		<desc>In the third installment of Capcom's Mega Man Zero series, you, unsurprisingly, play as Zero. Continuing where the Mega Man Zero 2 left off, you have to find and neutralize the recently escaped "Dark Elf," before it's able to brainwash the Resistance for the purpose of conquering Neo Arcadia. 

In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game also contains a new "chip" system, where Zero can gain new abilities by finding chips and installing chip in himself. But they didn't decide to abandon the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of "Cyber Space" to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as much as you please without them dying. However, there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it's better to spend more time in the normal level.</desc>

Each turtle (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael &amp; Donatello) has their own set of levels to complete, with their own distinct moves and combat options to use during battle. Along with a set of side-scrolling levels, complete with end of level boss battles, the four turtles will also get the chance to race through the sewers in the unique 3rd person race modes, shooting down the enemy or collecting items, while Donatello takes to the sky in the Shell Glider and Raphael challenges Casey Jones to a one-on-one cycle race.</desc>

		<name>Street Fighter Alpha 3</name>
		<desc>Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.

The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. 

World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).

Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)

Versus - Two human players battle it out. 

Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.

Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).

Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</desc>

		<path>./Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</name>
		<desc>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision's ever popular franchise.

The main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode.  When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.

All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.

The levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.

For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.

The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</desc>

Instead of standard bumpers, you're hitting the Pokéball against other Pokémon, and the ultimate goal is of course to "catch 'em all".

		<name>Worms World Party</name>
		<desc>The Worms are back, deadlier than ever.
You're going to learn that there's nothing more dangerous than a Worm with a bazooka or a shotgun...

At first sight, Worms World Party may seem very similar to Worms Armageddon. However, this time the game has been specially designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet.

Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from "Goliath Mode" to "Bleeding Worms", hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.</desc>

		<name>Alien Hominid</name>
		<desc>Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.</desc>

Apart from the single player puzzle experience (which includes more then 60 arenas), up to four people can play a collection of mini-games (which you must unlock in the single player game). Play monkey bowling (aka ten pin bowling), monkey fight (knock the other 3 players' monkey ball out of the circle arena) or an 18 hole mini golf challenge.</desc>

		<name>Racing Gears Advance</name>
		<desc>This handheld racing game offers a range of licensed cars, several courses and circuits, and a challenging set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.

With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose a Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and -- if possible -- upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).

The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.</desc>

		<desc>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past &amp; Four Swords for Game Boy Advance is a remake of A Link to the Past coupled with an entirely new game, Four Swords. This two-in-one game was released shortly before The Wind Waker.

While A Link to the Past is largely a faithful port of the original, it does include an entirely new dungeon and a new quest as rewards for the player playing through the multiplayer-only Four Swords. Aside from these additions, it includes a number of smaller gameplay and dialogue changes, the latter of which are designed to correct a number of minor translation mistakes and inconsistencies with the original Japanese release and to unify the common terms used with the later games.</desc>

		<name>Tomato Adventure</name>
		<desc>This story takes place in a land ruled by and intended for kids: the Ketchup Kingdom. On the holiday, Tomato Day, King Abiira makes an important announcement, declaring a rebirth of the nation with the help of the six Super Kids, and unveiling an awesome machine, the Super Cara-Cooker.

Unfortunately, just after the machine is unveiled, the TV of a boy named Demiru blows out. The adventure begins when you take control of Demiru, and set out to have your TV repaired..."

Tomato Adventure is a very cute and unique RPG meant for young kids, and is currently only available in Japan. It's fairly simple compared to the more complex RPGs out there. But I still think it's very fun; it reminds me a lot of Super Mario RPG.</desc>
