  "Football Academy is a mix of a football trivia game and a card game. In it the player gets to enter the academy where he under the supervision of former Chelsea and Portugal manager Luiz Felipe Scolari gets to create his own team and test his knowledge about the sport. When starting out at the academy the player gets two packs of cards with footballers. Once the player has picked his starting eleven out of these he will be able to go to the stadium and compete against unlocked teams. Victory in matches and the player is awarded badges, trophies and better card packs that allows him to improve his team. The player can't go directly to the stadium however. First he must prove his knowledge about game at the classroom. Here the player gets to take a Football IQ test consisting of three mini games. The accumulated points from the mini games is the player's football IQ which determines how good footballers the player can acquire. Early on the player only has access to bronze packs but by defeating teams in the stadium silver and gold packs will be unlocked. The test can be redone at any time but first it might be wise for the player to practice the mini games on the training pitch. Once the player has a team it is time to go to the changing room and manage it. Here the player gets to pick a formation and a starting eleven. Each footballer has a number of attributes such as position, nation and skill rating. The team also has a chemistry rating which is based on the footballers' home country as well as their preferred position and formation. Therefore it's important not only to pick the best ones, but also makes sure that they fit with their team mates. The actual matches of the game are played similarly to manager games such as Championship Manager where the player only gets to see an overview of the action. The tactical possibilities available are more limited here as the only options available are where to attack (left, right or center) and the mentality of the team (push up, sit back or balanced). What special however is that at different times throughout the matches the player will face dribbling, passing and shooting battles. Here one of the footballers will face one of the opponents. Before the battle the footballers' ratings are recalculated based on their mentality, chemistry and energy. Then each player gets to choose one of two actions and depending on if he is successful or not the footballer's rating increases or decreases. The footballer with the highest rating wins the battle. Being successful leads to more and more battles until a goal scoring opportunity appears. Football Academy has support for two player multi-card play. The players can test out their teams against each other but it is also possible to trade footballers.": "",

  "This is the Nintendo DS release of the well-received match-3 game Jewel Match for Windows/Macintosh. Due to the limited screen size of the handheld, the grid size of the levels had to be cut down from 14x14 to 12x12 tiles, thus forcing a complete redesign of all the levels. While at it the developers added some DS-only gameplay options like the new magical storm where the player can blow into the microphone to reshuffle the jewels. The basic idea of Jewel Match comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - the player is presented with a grid of jewels. By swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, rows of three or more identical jewels can be formed that will disappear instantly, giving points to the player and making room for other gems falling from above to take their place. The levels have gaps and shaped areas, though, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can fall diagonally. Jewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each of the 150 levels, a selection of squares have gold or even silver backings. One match (gold) or two (silver) must be created over each of these against a ticking clock to clear the level. Later in the game there are jewels tied to their square with a golden or silver chain, which thus are not falling down and blocking empty squares beneath them. These jewels can be freed by matching them once or twice, too, which means that the most difficult squares must be matched four times (silver chain and silver background) to be cleared. A succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a particular jewel, the second not only removes the gem but also any effects (background or chains) on the square, and the final one removes all gems of that colour. Another extra to be unlocked is a magical storm that will have the player blow into the DS microphone to mix up the jewels. Moreover, matching more than three jewels in a row will create gems with special powers. Matching four will create a joker gem while matching five gives a gem that, once activated, will destroy the whole row it is in. The game also offers a hot seat mode where two players can play the same level right after another, competing for the better clearing time.": "",

The player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal. The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid. The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors. New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.": "",
