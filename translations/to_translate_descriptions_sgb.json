  "Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it's later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version. To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted. There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!": "",

  "In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3D movement, Toshinden's game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves. Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls. The U.S and E.U PlayStation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older. The later DOS version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese PlayStation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on PlayStation.": "",

  "Brain Drain is a puzzle game in which the player has to recreate a pattern, consisting of different symbols like apples or hearts, which is shown in the corner of the screen. The main playing field consists of said symbols, but randomly switched around. The player controls a frame which encloses four of the symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit. In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by \"?\" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied automatically.

None dared challenge him, and the people of the country lived in fear and terror - until a young girl rose up and decided to take matters into her own hands. That young girl was Sonia Belmont, the first in the line of the legendary Belmont clan. While Castlevania Legends plays similar to the earlier Castlevania titles (the protagonist is only armed with a whip and needs to fight her way through five stages plus a hidden stage), there are also some unique features. While it is impossible to roam the stages freely, quite often the player can choose to go one way or another and in doing so skip some areas or find valuable items, collecting all of which will unlock the best ending. Sonia also possesses special power called Burning mode: once in a level (and once per life) she can boost her speed and attack power and become invincible for a short period of time. Each of the game's bosses leaves behind an orb with a Soul weapon inside. Sonia can collect five of these weapons: Wind, Ice, Flame, Saint and Magic.

  "The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as \"isometric\") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles.

The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play.

  "Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported. Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon. The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece. Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played. In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.) In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.": "",

Nimbus: here Hugo rides around a mountain on a Danish vintage motorcycle brand called 'Nimbus', with the goal being the witches cave, and a treasure chest there. On the mountain path he has to avoid rocks falling from above, goats trying to push him off the path, and at the same time pick up fuel canisters and bags of coins. Again, there is a map to follow, as the path branches off along the way to other more dangerous caves. Underjorden: Hugo explores an underground labyrinth of tunnels, slowly filling with rising water. A map is essential to find elevators and climbing ropes; in the tunnels are monsters such as dragons and jumping skulls to avoid. Ballong: Hugo has to fly in a leaky balloon, following a map to his final goal, landing in a cave without touching the walls.Provided the player clears/avoids all obstacles, there is a short movie sequence after each mini-game showing the main story of Hugo's adventures unfolding.

You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount. In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.": "",

  "Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps. The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts. Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the \"gold\" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.": "",
  "Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo. The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a \"wall\" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop. Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area. The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button. All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.": "",

Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries for DOS, Macintosh and Game Boy. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man. However, SNES game, despite using the same basic gameplay mechanics, is an entirely new game using a different game engine and aesthetic.": "",
  "One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board. Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.": "",

  "European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill. The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect. As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.": "",
  "Picross 2 is the Japanese only sequel to the Game Boy puzzle game, Mario's Picross. Your goal is to reveal the hidden picture inside each grid by chipping away the correct squares. Clues along the grid's edges help you figure out which squares should be chipped away, and which should be left alone. The puzzles are much more advanced than those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are in a 15x15 grid, while standard Picross puzzles are four 15x15 grids connected together, solved one section at a time. Picross 2 has two modes of play: the first, Mario's Picross, has you solving Picross puzzles with Mario. In this mode, the timer ticks down from 30 minutes, and you must solve the puzzle before the timer reaches zero. If you chip away an incorrect square, you are penalized time (first two minutes, then four, then eight). After solving a certain amount of puzzles in Mario's Picross mode, you can play Wario's Picross. In this mode, the timer starts from zero and counts upwards. You are not penalized time for any mistakes, however, this means that you do not know which squares are correct and which ones are incorrect until the puzzle is complete.": "",

Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters. This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.

  "Pocahontas is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Native American Indian later made famous in a Disney movie by the same name. The player alternates between Pocahontas and John Smith to complete seven missions. In levels one, two and four, Pocahontas needs to collect feathers for a Shaman woman to receive magic cards, travel through the forest while avoiding the spirit beat, and shake off a boy who chases her to prevent her from reaching the white man's camp respectively. John Smith is playable in the levels three, five and six. In the third level the American explorer needs to shoot animals running and passing by, on separate planes, by aiming his gun with the mouse. He needs to shoot enough animals to feed his men before it gets dark. The objective is the same in the fifth level, but there he is in a canoe and needs to catch fish. In the sixth level he leaps over ravines and across rivers until he meets Pocahontas. Together, they help each other cross a lake. In the final level both characters are controlled as they need to work together to catch a bear. Next to regular platforming mechanics such as running, climbing, jumping and swinging, there are some minor puzzle elements involving items that are selected from the bottom of the screen. That part also holds a progress bar to show how close the objectives are. Characters are generally controlled with four movement keys. The mouse cursor is visible on the screen and acts as a guide to show the possible actions. Clicking left or right offers different actions.": "",

  "When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship. With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home. Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link's Awakening. Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly. This can be risky, as certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it. The game also features a unique \"merge\" system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items. For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow. There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it's up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.": "",
  "An egg arrives from a far-off planet in outer space. This egg contains a 'Tamagotchi', a baby alien that cannot fend for itself, and requires your attention and care. Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up. Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name. In it, you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room.
