  "Also known as Video Chess, this is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move. To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened. Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.": "",

  "A good alternate title for this one would be Rows - not the kind you have when your wife finds lipstick on your shirt collar, but as an equivalent of Columns. The gameplay is essentially the same - groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather than vertically. Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).": "",

  "Some Background On Moonbase lo The idea behind Moonbase lo (pronounced eye-oh) was inspired by the flights of Voyagers 1 and 2, which took detailed pictures of Jupiter and its moons. Jupiter is the largest and most spectacular of the planets in our solar system. Its gravitational and magnetic fields are incredibly powerful, and extend millions of miles into space. The Voyagers used the gravitational fields of Jupiter as a kind of \"sling shot\" to whip the craft out to the farthest planets in the solar system. Jupiter's largest moons-lo, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto - range in size from slightly smaller than our moon to a little larger than the planet Mercury. They were the first bodies in the solar system to be discovered with a telescope by Galileo in 1610. Jupiter's other moons are much smaller. One moon, Anathea, is cigar-shaped. The moon lo is particularly interesting because it has visible volcanoes on its surface. The three moons lo, Europa and Ganymede were picked for bases in this game. They are appropriate landing sites for spacecraft because they had solid, relatively smooth surfaces. Jupiter itself is a monstrous ball of liquid and gas, with no solid surface to land on.": "",

Like Defender, there are lots of different aliens to contend with, and some ground based enemies as well. There are no smart bombs, however. You have to rescue humans as well (twice) from both an alien ship, and later a city that will be overrun with lava from a volcano that erupts during the game; all the while protecting them from aliens. You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely.

  "Mike Lamb recreated the basic rules of the popular English game of snooker in this simulation, which can be played by one or two players, but has no computer opponent as such, unlike the later 16-bit remake. Instead, you are scored based not only on how many points you score legitimately, but also on how many points you concede through foul shots, and how many shots you take in total. You always take the next shot, even if you've missed or fouled, so in a one player game the break-building strategies can be slightly more aggressive than in a real match, as there's no risk of leaving an opponent a chance.": "",

The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles.

Each screen contains a number of electrical charges, knowing that alike charges attract and that hitting most objects will slow the ball, the key to the game is to use the electrical charges to \"slingshot\" the ball.

  "Fred is a platform game, where the player controls a caveman, walking horizontally through the levels. Like in nearly every platform game, there are hanging platforms for the caveman to jump on, though sometimes parts of the platforms give way. Climbable ropes also appear.

Another weapon is the spray can; when found, Fred can spray in front of himself, killing enemies this way. Contact with an enemy or a hazard (such as a cactus) costs a life and sends the player back to the last checkpoint. Weapons can also be used to crack open jugs found along the way.

  "The fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them. Instead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.": "",

Then they basically exchange blows until one unit lost all of its soldiers. The game also factors in fatigue and morale. The time is measured with an in-game clock and a match ends after eleven hours (30 minutes in real-time).

First you must break through your own, and then your opponent's, barrier in order to score a hit, but careful planning is required as the deflectors could force your shot back into your area and you could end up blasting yourself!

Opening the wrong door or dropping down the wrong hole can easily make the game impossible to complete. There are two energy meters, one representing hunger and one representing thirst. Both of them drop constantly and need to be refilled with the appropriate pickups. Occasionally, small tracked mines will randomly drive onto the screen; colliding with them drains both energy meters quickly. If either energy meter reaches zero, the game is over. The game also ends if the agent walks into a sensor that activates a defense turret; switches can be found which temporarily deactivate sensors when pressed.": "",

Nimno is going to have to dodge its ground fire as he fights the two new green aliens filtering down from orbit. Suddenly a red homing suicide ship appears. This turns the situation from bad to desperate. Nimno slows down, firing burst after burst, in a vain hope of destroying the ship before it rams him, but the wildly dodging ship avoids them all.

In a final desperation move, Nimno zooms up to avoid the ground fire, dodges the missiles of the descending lander, hits it with a lucky burst, and zooms down to skim the ground, barely being missed by the homing suicide ship. He is so busy thanking his lucky stars for this narrow escape that he fails to see the approaching lunar mountain in time to react...
