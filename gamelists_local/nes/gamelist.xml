		<name>Tetris</name>
		<desc>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, as well as the best-known (but not the only) version on Nintendo's first home console. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The game offers two different modes of play, "Type A" and "Type B". "Type A" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.</desc>

		<name>Ganbare Goemon Gaiden 2 : Tenka no Zaihou</name>
		<desc>This is a sequel to the  first Ganbare Goemon Gaiden (side-story) RPG. Goemon, a cunning thief and an avid treasure hunting, has nothing to do and sits in his house, bored. But his trusty friend Ebisumaru has good news: there is a big treasure to find somewhere in a big city across the sea. Of course the treasure won't be just given to Goemon: he'll have to perform a dangerous mission before. The two friends board a ship and thus the journey begins...

The game is very similar to its predecessor, as well as to most other console-style RPGs of the period. You talk to people in towns, buy various equipment, descend into dungeons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat. The combat perspective is slightly changed in this sequel (over-the-shoulder view of the battle instead of semi-animated pictures).</desc>

		<desc>The Red Star nation and the Blue Moon nation are at war. Each has deployed troops and works to obtain enough funds so as to buy the necessary military hardware to overcome the other side.

Famicom Wars is a turn-based strategy game. The player takes the role of commander of military forces for either the Red Star or Blue Moon armies. The goal of each battle map is to overcome the other side's forces, destroying all enemy units and capturing all enemy-held landmarks. Each side of the battle takes their turn, moving units across the map. The capture of cities will give that side extra funds which can be used to build new units at factories and shipyards.

Famicom Wars features 17 maps total to battle across.</desc>

		<name>Batman : Return of the Joker</name>
		<desc>The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. 

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.

Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. 

This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.</desc>

		<desc>The lovely princess Lala was kidnapped by the Evil Demons of the Empire. You are Lolo, a round ball-like creature (just like the princess herself), and your mission is to sneak into the empire castle and to liberate the princess.

Adventures of Lolo is a puzzle game, and each level is a castle room. The goal in each room is to collect all the hearts. It is not always easy, because some hearts are blocked by enemies who will shoot you when you cross their path horizontally or vertically (or both). Once you collect all the hearts, a treasure chest will open and activate all the creatures in the room, even those who were not hostile until now. You must quickly cross the room to the exit which is now available to go to the next room. The game contains 50 rooms in total.

The difficulty level increases with each room, and after a few levels there is an especially hard room with tougher enemies.</desc>

But Cubby and Rubby have two skills their ancestors did not: by holding down the attack button, they can float upwards - and by releasing it, they'll fire several bubbles at once. They can also pick up special items that increase their points, speed and attack power. This game features 80 levels, all-new enemies, and bonus mini-games.</desc>

		<desc>Panic Restaurant is a side-scrolling platform game where you play as chef Cookie. The rival chef Ohdove has taken over his restaurant and it's up to Cookie to reclaim it.

It is a fairly basic platform game. You run and jump, and enemies are placed all around to try and stop you. The entire game, backgrounds, enemies and bosses, is food-themed. You encounter things such as sausages, microwave ovens, onions and hamburgers on your way through the restaurant. To your help you always have a frying pan to beat the enemies with, and you can also find other items, such as a spoon, and plates to throw at the enemies.

The game contains 6 stages, each in a separate location in the restaurant, such as the kitchen, freezer and basement. At the end of each level you are faced with a boss. In between each level is a bonus game where you play a slot machine to try and win some extra health and lives.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda</name>
		<desc>In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.

The game is drawn in a top-down perspective and is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.</desc>

He asks Kid Klown to help him open a treasure vault, but Kid Klown, having been warned about the evil magician by his parents, refuses. Not willing to give up so easily, Night Mayor kidnaps Kid Klown's family and dares him to follow him into his world if he ever wants to see his family again.

Kid Klown in Night Mayor World is a side-scrolling platformer. Kid Klown has to complete several different stages inhabited by various enemies. His most helpful tools are his balloons that he can throw at his enemies, use as a trampoline or cling to in order to float through the air. 

There are various items to be picked up as well, including bonus lifes, health power-ups, strawberries, lightnings that make Kid Klown temporarily invincible and question marks that can have the same effect as any of the other items, but might also reverse the controls.

After every completed stage, a bonus game can be played in which Kid Klown may win items by throwing balloons at them. The number of balloons available depends on the number of strawberries collected in the previous stage.</desc>

		<name>The Goonies II</name>
		<desc>In a movie released in the 1980s, a group of youngsters formed a special gang and called themselves The Goonies.  Nintendo banked upon the movie’s popularity by releasing several games using the characters and music from it, including the theme song by Cyndi Lauper.  This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.

You play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gang’s arch enemy – the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it won’t be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.  You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill.  If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesn’t stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!

Upon starting the game, Mikie is armed only with a yo-yo and the ability to jump.  As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.

There is more than typical side-scrolling action, although there’s certainly a multitude of that.  Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you.  When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls.  A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.</desc>

		<name>Rampart</name>
		<desc>A medieval masterpiece of power, strategy, and ingenuity!

The objective is brutally simple: engage your enemy in an all-out exchange of cannonfire, then assess the damage and rebuild your castle.

But the reality of RAMPART is far more complex. The key to victory lies in how quickly you can pick up the pieces and redesign, refortify, and extend your walls before the next battle begins.

Whether you're facing an onslaught from the computer's armada, or pitting your castle cannons against another player's, there's only one way out. Defend... or perish.</desc>

		<name>Zombie Nation</name>
		<desc>In 1999 a mysterious object crashes into the desert and a mysterious creature, Darc Seed appears. Using magnetic powers, he soon turns the people of the United States into zombies and exerts influence over various weapons and objects. Among the weapons Darc Seed claims is the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.

What makes this so unusual however is that "great head of the samurai" is to be taken literally and Namakubi therefore is a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.</desc>

  The first four chapters are played from the viewpoint of one character per chapter, who will all meet up in the fifth chapter.  From a soldier to a merchant, the game weaves an intriguing story that ties all four characters together in the end.
  Also new in Dragon Warrior 4 is the introduction of battle tactics where the lineup of the characters is important to how much damage they deal.  The player is even given the opportunity to swap a character from reserve into the battle to add a whole new depth of strategy.</desc>

Unlike the two previous Lolo games, Adventures of Lolo 3 lets you wander around a world map to explore different locations in a non-linear fashion. However, some of the locations are blocked and will only open up after you earn the correct a key by completing another level.

The gameplay is very similar to the two previous games. You have to collect all the hearts in each room while avoiding the enemies trying to stop you. Once you have eaten all the hearts, more enemies will appear to try and keep you from reaching the exit. The puzzles involve mostly pushing things to prevent enemies from stopping you.</desc>

The game keeps the straightforward side-scrolling beat 'em up formula and even removes some of the maze-like elements in the previous game, adding new weapons and upgrades to make the game more action-oriented. Wandering through the stages is still possible and you can enter several stores and locations and trigger amusing humorous sequences keeping in tone with the lighthearted spirit of the series.</desc>

Butler plans to feature the pets in his intergalactic zoo, and what's worse, he's destroyed the Great Gazoo's time machine so that no-one could stop him!  It's up to everyone's favourite caveman, Fred Flintstone, to find the pieces to the time machine and repair it, so that they can travel to the future and confront Dr. Butler once and for all!

The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy is a side-scrolling platformer for the NES.  In it, you control Fred Flintstone through various locations such as Bedrock, Reef Rock, the Jungle and more as he searches for the missing pieces of Gazoo's time machine.

Fred can collect coins after defeating enemies, which are used to pay for secondary weapons like slingshots and tomahawks, as well as special abilities such as flying and diving.

After completing the first level, the player is presented with an overworld map that allows you to choose which level you'd like to go to.

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II : The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is kidnapped by the villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and Rocksteady. The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue April. They battle familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with Shredder himself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is a port of the popular arcade game made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity. Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady).

The NES version of the game features additional content not present in other versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.</desc>

The sky rains meteorites upon the World Tree - wild animals and evil monsters terrorize the citizens - the water supply from the wells is dwindling - plants are withering - people are dying.

There are many places you must visit during your quest including the medieval town, where you begin, country villages, fortresses, caves, and gloomy bogs - each with its own ambiance and musical score. You will be talking with the villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over obstacles and using items. Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell.</desc>

		<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

Each team member can be one of three player types: small and skinny (very fast, but not good at checking or shooting), very large (slow, but with a strong body check and outstanding shooting strength) or average (medium speed, with average checking and shooting strength). After the teams are set up, it's time to play some ice hockey! Gameplay features a scrolling screen to follow the action, and lets you choose which of the players you wish to control when on defense (on offense you always control the player with the puck). Fights can break out between players, and the loser may end up in the penalty box. There are five different speed settings for the game, and periods can be either 7, 10, or 15 minutes long.</desc>

But one day, minister Pumpkin betrayed king Broccoli, kidnapped princess Tomato, stole the royal Turnip Emblem, and took them to his castle in Zucchini mountains. He sent his cruel Farmies to terrorize the Salad Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, the king died, unable to recover from the loss of his beautiful daughter. But he promised you, the brave Sir Cucumber, the princess' hand and the entire kingdom, if you save the beautiful Tomato from the clutches of the evil Pumpkin. 

Princess Tomato is an adventure game in which you interact with the environment by choosing commands from a menu, such as the traditional "check" or "give", and the less traditional "praise" or "percy". Percy is a little persimmon who will be your trusty side-kick throughout your quest and who will help you on many occasions. The puzzles are on the simple side, and are primarily based on talking to characters, finding items and giving them.</desc>

But Kuro knocked Shiro to the ground, and then left the money so that he would be framed. Now Shiro has been taken to jail and must fight his way out of this place using the only method he knows: explosive bombs.

Dynablaster is the second Bomberman game in the series and plays similar to the first, only all gameplay has been reduced to a single screen. Your goal however remains the same on a smaller playing area. You are to destroy all enemies on a level and then find the exit to the next one. Bombing the exit is always a bad idea. The occasional power-up will increase your bomb blast, number of bombs on the screen at one time, player speed or give you the ability to walk through walls.

This game introduces a Versus Mode for 2 players and a Battle Mode for 3. Your goal in these is to destroy the other players while staying alive yourself.</desc>

Burai Fighter is an arcade shooter with two modes of play.  Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts.  A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout.  Either way, you'll be armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything onscreen.

Burai Fighter uses a slightly different gameplay mechanic when compared to other shooters. You can shoot in 8 directions, and when you hold down the fire button you keep shooting in that direction.</desc>

		<name>Jackal</name>
		<desc>The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war, unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but a small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people, would be minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your grenades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, escort them to a safe landing zone and fight a boss battle.</desc>

		<name>Wacky Races</name>
		<desc>Despite what the name implies, Wacky Races for NES is not a racing game, and has nothing to do with the other games bearing the same name but the license. In this game, the player takes control of Muttley, the grumbling, but loyal dog from the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon. His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. 

Muttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III : The Manhattan Project</name>
		<desc>This was the last side-scrolling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game for NES. It followed the highly acclaimed Turtles II over a year later and, unlike its predecessor, doesn't have an Arcade counterpart.

The third game in the series is basically the same as the second. The story and the stages are different, of course, but it doesn't really matter. Choose your favourite turtle and kill as many Foot Clan soldiers as you can, fight the bosses and reach Shredder in a Double Dragon-styled game.

The graphics and gameplay were improved. And, if the choice of the turtle depended only on personal taste in the second game (as they were all the same, in different colors), in this third episode they gained individual special moves.</desc>

		<path>./Shadowgate (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Shadowgate</name>
		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.</desc>

		<name>Splatter House : Wanpaku Graffiti</name>
		<desc>Wanpaku Graffiti is the first Splatterhouse game to appear on a home console. It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.

Although the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.</desc>

The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.

The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<desc>Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode. There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots.

There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen. Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap. A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</desc>

		<name>Legacy of the Wizard</name>
		<desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.

Legacy of the Wizard is an side-scrolling action platform game with role-playing elements.  The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-resoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

		<desc>Randy, the Holy Diver, is setting out to retrieve the five emblem seals belonging to the King Crimson Family in order to expel the greatest evil, the Black Slayer, back into another dimension.

Holy Diver is an action game much in the vein of Castlevania. The player controls the Diver as he uses magic powers such as shooting energy balls and freezing time to traverse the game's eight levels. Enemies throughout the levels respawn and there are destroyable objects in your path. At the end of each level a tougher boss character must be beaten. Once defeated a power-up spell becomes available to the player. To use these spells the player must pause the game and select it from the inventory menu. The player has the ability to shoot horizontally as well as up. Difficult paths may sometimes be crossed by the combination of the right spell at the right time such as the freezing spell that freezes quicksand. 

Though scheduled for release in North America, the game never went beyond its release in Japan.</desc>

		<path>./Xexyz (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Xexyz</name>
		<desc>It's the year 2777. Due to nuclear wars and natural disasters, Earth's population has decreased dramatically and only five island are left, forming the nation of Xexyz. In Xexyz, humans, spirits and faeries have lived peacefully for centuries under the reign of King Xeu Star. One day, Xexyz is attacked by Goruza who murders the king, builds mechanical castles on each island and captures the queen of each island. You take on the role of a soldier named Apollo who wants to put an end to Goruza's reign.

Controlling Apollo, it is your task to free all five islands. Freeing an island is done in several different phases that feature 'Jump'n Shoot' as well as 'Shooter' levels (called "Action Mode" and "Shooting Mode"). The first level of each island is a Jump'n Shoot level that contains many doors to shops, bonus games, friendly NPCs or mid-bosses. NPCs will sometimes give you important hints, items or weapons; bonus games can be played to win some money ("Balls"); defeating mid-bosses (and thereby freeing a Fairy) will get you a cash reward and shops also offer weapons and items. Weapons differ largely in attack power and range. Items have temporary effects such as invincibility or improved jumping abilities. In an island's first level, you will have to find a secret room and defeat a boss, for which you will receive a Force Star that is needed to gain access to a mechanical castle. Mechanical castles look similar to other Jump'n Shoot levels but are more complex.

Once you have made your way to a "Cyborg Rider", a self-scrolling Shooter sequence starts in which you have to shoot your way through lots of enemies while picking up speed and weapon power-ups.
At the end of this sequence you will leave the Cyborg Rider, and step onto a floating platform for a boss fight. After the boss is defeated, another Shooter sequence with another boss at the end awaits, but this time, the boss if fought from the Cyborg Rider. After defeating this boss, you start the process over with a Jump'n Shoot level.</desc>

A sudden rampage breaks out, and the cause is found to be a group of robots, led by a mysterious figure. As Dr. Light begins to investigate this rampage and attempts to find a way to stop it, he is kidnapped by the leader of the robots. Rockman hurries to save Dr. Light, but is too late...the only thing he can find at the scene is a yellow scarf...one that almost seems to belong to...Blues!?

		<name>Over Horizon</name>
		<desc>Over Horizon is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player has to guide a spaceship through various levels and destroy numerous enemies. The ship's weapons can be fired in tow directions and defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups that equip the ship with different weapons and up to two options. There are three different weapons in addition to the standard shot: Laser, homing missiles and bombs.

The "Edit Mode" presents an unusual feature. In it, players can determine the options positions (which can be changed by pressing the A and B button simultaneously), as well as the properties of the weapons. It is, for example, possible to have the laser behave like homing missiles or the homing missiles like bombs.</desc>

		<name>Kiwi Kraze : A Bird-Brained Adventure!</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

		<desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

		<name>Shadow of the Ninja</name>
		<desc>In the 21st century, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the city of New York, killing many of its inhabitants. You play as either Hayate or Kaede, two ninjas who are attempting to free the city from Garuda's control.

Shadow of the Ninja is a typical side-scrolling action game, consisting of running, slashing and jumping through 5 levels, each with 4 sub-stages with numerous and varied foes, and a boss enemy at their end.

Kaede and Hayate can not only jump; as ninjas, they can hang from platforms and make swift saltomortals between floors. Sometimes, canisters containing powerups can be found. Typical powerups extend range of the default sword, or they may be additional weapons such as throwing stars and a ninja weapon that looks like a big grappling hook on a string.

The game allowed two players to play cooperatively, a rare feature for action games outside of the Contra series.</desc>

The game is played as a side-scrolling beat 'em up, but with the added challenge of having to find the exit for the maze-like stages besides beating all the baddies. Goemon fights using his smoking pipe, but he can upgrade his weapon with power-ups found in the game or bought at several shops using the money collected from fallen enemies à la River City Ransom.

		<name>Chip 'N Dale : Rescue Rangers 2</name>
		<desc>Following the first Rescue Rangers game, the Rangers' overcame the plot of their arch-nemesis Fatcat, and locked him up in the prison/pound. However, Fatcat's henchmen have sprung him from prison by blimp. Suddenly a television news anchor is reporting that there is a bomb threat in a local restaurant. The Rescue Rangers take it upon themselves to save the day only to learn that the whole bomb scare was a diversion in order to allow Fatcat to steal an artifact known as the Urn of the Pharoah. The team must track Fatcat and learn what he has in store for the stolen goods.

Like the previous game, Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue Rangers 2 is a side-scrolling action game where 2 players can play simultaneously as Chip &amp; Dale, or 1 player can control either chipmunk. Our heroes must conquer a series of oversized (from their perspective) stages in order to thwart Fatcat's nefarious schemes. For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.</desc>

		<name>Kid Icarus</name>
		<desc>Far away in peaceful Angel Land lived a young angel warrior named Pit, who has been given the task of defeating the monstrous Medusa, who wishes to destroy Angel Land and all of the people, and she has started by kidnapping Palutena, the Princess of Angel Land.

Young Pit must rescue the Princess and restore peace to Angel Land. He will travel from the deep caverns of the Underworld to Medusa's palace in the sky on his journey, and deadly monsters will attack him every step of the way. But he has the power of the Gods on his side! A powerful bow and arrows, Water of Life, and Angel Feathers will assist Pit on his quest to destroy Medusa and save the princess!

Kid Icarus is a platform game where the player goes through several vertically outlaid levels, shooting enemies with his bow on the way and collecting hearts they leave behind. Pit's bow can shoot both forward and upwards. As Pit continues upwards, more and more of the level ends up beyond the bottom of the screen and if Pit falls down out of the screen, he dies. 

The levels contain doors which lead to chambers of various types - some chambers are filled with enemies, some are treasuries which allow Pit to obtain a power-up, some are stores where Pit can buy stuff, some will replenish his health, in some Pit will be able to take a test in hopes of getting a powerful weapon, and finally some chambers give Pit a chance of receiving a strength upgrade, therefore increasing the amount of damage his attacks deal. 

Pit earns experience as he defeats enemies, and he gains levels from this experience. The more levels Pit has, the more maximum health he has. 

Hearts taken from enemies are used in shops to buy various items and power-ups. Items include a protective shield which harms enemies, a more powerful bow, a mallet which allows you to smash the poor Palutena's warriors turned to stone who will later help you to fight a boss, a torch to see yourself in dark areas and others.</desc>

		<desc>Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.
There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.</desc>

Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters</desc>

		<desc>This is the third entry in the series of fast-paced ninja action games, and is the last game in the series to be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Some time has passed since the defeat of Ashtar and the resurrected Jaquio, and Irene Lew has received a new mission to complete. She is to observe a strange factory that has been constructed recently for an unknown purpose, and investigate it. She proceeds to reconnoiter it, but is intercepted and apparently assassinated by her friend Ryu Hayabusa...except it isn't Ryu. It is an imposter. The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory.

As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical "wave" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.

The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx.</desc>

Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

		<desc>In a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the arcade game, Blades Of Steel is a hockey arcade action game (gameplay doesn't require the need to worry about statistics or provide the ability to customize teams.) Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer. In one player mode there are single game and tournament mode options.  From time to time a fight may break out, which will provide a close up view of the two players. The player has control during the miniature fight game sequence, with the loser having to spend time in the penalty box.  The referee will break up fights that go on too long, and calls a few penalties such as icing. Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.</desc>

		<name>Batman Returns</name>
		<desc>Like Konami's other adaptation of Batman Returns, the NES version is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Next to brawling action, it also features two sections where the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat seen in the movie.

In the beat 'em up sections, Batman has to defeat a large number of enemies (members of the Penguin's circus gang) to advance. Possible attacks include punches, sliding attacks, drop kicks and a powerful 360° cape slash attack which will drain Batman's health bar. Gadgets to be used include a limited number of batarangs and a grappling hook. The hook is useful for many things: it can take down flying enemies, pull Batman up to higher levels, lets him climb into open windows and more. Hidden in background items somewhere in the levels are power-ups, including hearts that refill the health bar and extra batarangs.

Each of the six levels in the game concludes with a boss fight against one or more especially powerful enemies.

The Batmobile is armed with machine guns and bat discs, used to dispatch the enemy bikes and cars in the driving level. The Batskiboat section is similar, except that there are no enemies and the only goal is to collect coins for extra points.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you control a little baby! The baby crawls through imaginary worlds, made of candy, chocolate, toys, and other things a baby would dream of. It has to traverse those platform levels to defeat or avoid various enemies. The way the baby deals with the enemies is quite unusual: it inflates them. When inflated, the enemies lose control and begin to float, until they finally explode. The baby can use this to its advantage, riding the enemies while they are floating, kicking them to various directions, making them bounce off walls, using them as projectiles to hit other enemies, etc. Such strategies are necessary when dealing with the bosses you encounter. There are various items scattered through the levels, such as milk, which restores your health completely.</desc>

Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

Now our hero will have to work extra, EXTRA hard to buy it and impress Betty!

In Pizza Pop!, the player fights through seven crazy neighborhoods populated by a whole host of pizza-hungry characters. The player can, however, defeat his enemies by jumping on them, or whacking them with his pizza pan. The player can also run through the level or use motor vehicles to get around, but he can't run for too long or else he'll get tired - unless he jumps while running.

		<name>Radia Senki : Reimei Hen</name>
		<desc>You wake up in the middle of a forest. Your head hurts. You don't remember anything: you don't know who you are, and you vaguely recall your name. A man approaches you and says his name is Darus. After realizing that you are suffering from a strange amnesia, Darus takes you to a nearby village and soon reveals to you that he is a sorcerer on a quest for revenge. You join forces, and soon become involved in a complex mystery of a kidnapped princess, the destruction of the world, and search for your own identity...

Radia Senki is set in a semi-modern, semi-medieval environment, and introduces an unusual blend between action and strategic RPG. During the pre-set (not random) battles, your party and the enemies can freely move around the battle screen. You control the main character by attacking in real time, but you can pause at any time and give a command to other party members: attack a specified enemy, be offensive in general, use a healing or other technique, pretend to be dead, etc.</desc>

		<name>Snake's Revenge</name>
		<desc>An unofficial sequel to the original Metal Gear for the NES. Three years has passed since the Outer Heaven incident. FOX-HOUND has gained intelligence that an unknown terrorist group has seized a remote facility containing mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, as well as a new Metal Gear prototype which was under development. The newly-promoted Lt. Solid Snake is called back into action to infiltrate the terrorists' base with the help of two FOX-HOUND rookies, former marine Nick Myer and navy intelligence agent John Turner.

The player once again assume the role of Snake. The objective is similar to the previous game, as the player must avoid any kind of visual contact (even moreso than the first game), while collecting weapons and equipment on-site. There is a greater variety of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a train, a couple of prisons and even a cargo ship containing the mass-produced Metal Gears. The player must also overcome new traps such as searchlights, soldiers in gyrocopters, door-sealing devices and even suicide bombers. The player must also interrogate captured enemy officers by injecting them with a truth serum to increase their rank, in addition to saving hostages like in the first game. Side-scrolling areas are also included in addition to the main overhead game, where the game takes a more action-oriented route (while still maintaining the stealth premise).</desc>

		<desc>In the far future, Earth is a peaceful place with very few worries.  To ensure it stays that way, a top secret project was authorized: the creation of the guardian suit.  It's a suit of flight armor that allows the guardian to survive any environment.  It's a good thing too, because a giant space station is spotted on a collision course with Earth.

You take the role of the guardian.  Your mission is to activate the station's self-destruct and destroy it before it collides with Earth.  As you travel through the station NAJU, you'll find increased armor and better weapons to help you defeat waves of enemies.  You'll battle through the station in a human form and also as a jet in certain areas.</desc>

Many people went to visit, and the park was very popular. The princess asked Yanchamaru if he would like to go with her, but since he was busy with his training, she went by herself.

Each stage is based around a theme, such as a world built from cakes and a world built from volcanoes, and each is filled with animatronic enemies, with a boss at the end. Yanchamaru has his trusty spinning sword, and can also find bonus items to improve his abilities and increase his score.</desc>

		<path>./Dragon Warrior III (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Dragon Warrior III</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.</desc>

		<desc>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on NES is an action game in which you control the famous ninja turtles Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael. You can switch between them whenever you want to take advantage of each one's weapons and characteristics and thus defeat the evil Shredder.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

It's here where Inuyama Wanko-no-Kami, Chief of the Palace guard, steps in - by bringing in the Secret Ninja Team Nyankii! Whenever Wanko-No-Kami hears that Ko'on No Kami is plotting something, he dispatches the Nyankiis from their secret base at the Pizza Cat Restaurant so they can stop him before he is successful.

However, there are rumors that a foreign scientist called Dr. Purple is aiding Ko'on No Kami... but for what purpose? What could Ko'on No Kami be planning this time?

Kyatto Ninden Teyandee is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of Ninja Gaiden, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko Productions and Sotsu agency. There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the three main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members: Yattaro, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; Pururun, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.

By pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four Rescue Team members in order to use their special abilities: Rikinoshin can break boulders, Mietoru can fly for a limited time, Gotton can drill through certain walls, and Nekkii can swim easily and use water attacks. You can only use their abilities for a limited amount of time, which can be recovered by picking up items with a cat paw printed on it.

All seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.</desc>

		<name>Castlevania II : Simon's Quest</name>
		<desc>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest is the second one of three Castlevania games released on the NES. After the vampire killer Simon Belmont destroyed Count Dracula in the original Castlevania (1987), an evil curse possessed him. The only way Simon can break the count's curse is to find five of Dracula's body parts (which are mysteriously strewn throughout Transylvania) and burn them. 

Unlike most of the other Castlevania games, Simon's Quest does not feature the traditional stages but allows you to freely roam the land of Transylvania in the style of Nintendo's Metroid. In several towns Simon can talk with NPC's and buy items in shops, adding a touch of role-playing.</desc>

		<desc>Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment.</desc>

He counts on his three nephews and on other Duck Tales characters to help him in his quest through inospit places such as the Amazononic forest, the African Mines, the Himalayas, Transylvania (where he meets Dracula Duck) and even the Moon.

Each one of them reserves the old duck lots of adventure, different enemies and hidden rooms.

The game features a 2D side-scrolling platform gameplay very similar to Mega Man. Graphics are colorful and cartoonish, music remembers players of the TV series and controls are very simple.</desc>

		<name>Sweet Home</name>
		<desc>"Sweet Home" follows the exploits of five members of
an investigation group: Kazuo, Akiko, Taro, Asuka, and Emi. The famous painter Mamiya Ichirou lived many years in a secluded mansion, and rumor says there are some valuable frescos to find inside. Our investigators decide to take some pictures of the frescos. However, upon entering the mansion, a ghost-like figure of Mamiya appears  and threatens them. After this, they find themselves trapped in the mansion. The heroes must now find a way out of the mansion, not forgetting the frescos they came there for, and the destiny of an earlier investigation group that has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

"Sweet Home" is perhaps the first known example of survival horror genre, created by the same company that later made the famous  Resident Evil. However, "Sweet Home" is also a console-style RPG: characters fight random monsters in turn-based battles, equip various weapons and level up. You can (and must) form different teams from the five available characters, both for battles and for solving puzzles. Each character has his (or her) own item-based skill: Taro can take pictures, Emi can unlock almost any door, Kazuo has a lighter, Akiko uses a vacuum cleaner to remove dust and other obstacles, and Asuka has medical kits.

The game was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<name>Power Blade 2</name>
		<desc>Christmas Eve, 2200.

The Delta Foundation has just finished the development of a cyborg unit which represents a new generation of fighting robots. They want to sell it to the government's department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.

Power Blade 2 has six stages which involves you running through the level, while killing off enemies and avoiding hazards. At the start, you can choose which stage to start at, but unlike Power Blade, once you have chosen a stage, you can't exit and choose another one until you have completed the current one first. Nearly each stage involves you using your wits, as you dodge spikes, jumping towards the top of the screen to avoid fire, and getting fans to lift you onto platforms. You can also slide your way through tight spots, as long as you slide in the right place.

At the end of each stage, you fight a different boss. However, in the end, you must fight all the bosses you fought before before you get to fight the alien leader.</desc>

		<desc>The peaceful island Coolmint is attacked by flame monsters sent by the evil wizard Druidle. The queen of the winter fairies chooses the novice wizard Dana to drive back the monsters. Fire 'n Ice is a puzzle game where the goal is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. You can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally in the direction faced, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so you have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. So it's possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless on icy surface).</desc>

		<name>Crisis Force</name>
		<desc>The year is 199x and a robot army has invaded Tokyo City. A boy and a girl board their ships to fight off the threat.

This is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up game viewed from overhead, where the player pilots a fighter ship through seven levels of intense shooting action. Each level hurls enemies and bullets at the player's ship, ending with a boss fight, except for one which instead is a boss rush level. The game allows for two players to play at the same time.

The player has a choice of two weapons; bullets or lasers. Weapons can be changed by picking up gems of different colors. Picking up the same color as you already have allows you to upgrade your current weapon a few times. The player's ship can change form and with it the way that the weapons work. This allows the player to pick the best weapon strategy for each situation. The player also has a limited amount of bombs that are useful to get out of tricky situations.

When a weapon is upgraded it also acts as a shield so the ship can take an enemy bullet without dying. This will however degrade the weapon down to the first level again. There are also pickups that alter the ship's speed and a special gem that, if five of them are collected, temporarily transforms the ship into an invincible super ship.</desc>

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.</desc>

		<desc>T&amp;C Surf Designs features both skateboarding and surfing games. The skating section (called Street Skate Session) is a side scrolling action game where you need to navigate through an obstacle course within the given time limit. Ideally you want to earn as many points as possible by performing tricks, jumping over items, and collecting bonuses. If you crash too many times (or fall into a hole, run out of time, etc...) then the game will be over. In the surfing section (called Big Wave Encounter) you need to surf a giant wave all the way to the beach. As with skating, you can earn points by performing tricks and collecting bonuses; likewise the game ends if you crash too many times. You can choose to play either game individually, or alternate between the two (the Wood &amp; Water Rage option). You can select several T&amp;C Surf Designs characters to play as, including Thrilla Gorilla, Kool Kat, Joe Cool, and Tiki Man.</desc>

		<name>The Lone Ranger</name>
		<desc>In the early 1880's in Texas, a man has returned to bring  justice to the outlaw who murdered his brother and his former comrades, the Texas Rangers. His name is the Lone Ranger. The outlaw, whose name is Butch Cavendish, has now kidnapped the President. The time has come for the masked man to begin his journey of adventure for the purpose of safely rescuing the President and avenging the deaths of his brother and former comrades.

The game takes you through 8 western-themed regions, each 
with a different objective, all of which brings you closer to your nemesis, Butch Cavendish. The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.

Each bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled gun. Your gun shoots standard bullets but can also fire silver bullets which are stronger than the standard ones.</desc>

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.

		<desc>G.I Joe is a side-scrolling action game where you can select 3 out of a possible 5 characters to complete a mission. 

Each level is in three main parts:  The fight into the mission zone, the mission zone, and the escape from the mission zone.  The stages where you fight into and escape from the mission zone are straightforward action – just fight your way to the end of the stage, and defeat the stage boss.

The actual mission zone is a maze, where the object is to place bombs at pre-determined locations, then find and use the exit.  The mazes start out easy with the first one being only two screens high and 4 long.  Level 6 is 7 by 8 for a total of 56 screens.

Characters:

Duke (Tiger Force first sergeant/squad leader), Rock &amp; Roll (gatling gunner), Capt. Grid-Iron (hand-to-hand combat specialist), Blizzard (arctic attack soldier), Snake Eyes (commando)</desc>

In these levels you start off with the main character Rickle (or Rikkuru), who by collecting a special power-up, can transform temporarily into one of the three different characters the player chose at the beginning of the game. There are also space shooter, driving, and puzzle levels. After certain levels you can choose different paths which consist of different stages.</desc>

You begin play as Hebereke (Bop Louie in PAL regions), a penguin (though in PAL release he is more humanoid and looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man), and must explore the world on which you and three other friends crash landed. As you encounter the new characters you must fight them to make them recover their memory.  Once you have recovered all 3 other characters you are then searching for Temple Keys which will lead back to your homeworld of Ufouria.

The world in which you interact is free form, meaning that you can wander around as you please. To get to new areas you will need to get power-ups and/or new characters with their own abilities. Character switching is done as needed, not defined by levels.  Sections of the game have bosses and mini-bosses which include the characters which have not had their memory returned yet.</desc>

		<name>Spot : The Video Game</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.

When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</desc>

		<desc>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</desc>

The gameplay and artistic style are heavily influenced by the NES Mega Man games (some contend the elements are "borrowed" or "stolen", in fact). The game is a side scroller in which the heroine can wield a variety of different offensive capabilities (all available from the start of the game), selectable via a subscreen in her quest to wipe out wave after wave of robot invaders throughout the four levels. You also have a limited range broomstick at your disposal for riding across chasms and such.</desc>

Through the game you'll encounter all kinds of mechanical and biomechanical creatures. Shatterhand's primary weapon is his cybernetic fists and therefore most enemies must be defeated by punching them.

Additional help can be given from any of the 8 hovering satellite robots, each of which has it's own weapon that fires automatically when Shatterhand throws a punch. These satellite robots can be obtained by collecting combinations of alpha-beta letters that appear when you punch some of the white boxes that are scattered throughout each stage.

The game has 7 stages. The first and the last must be played first and last respectively, but the five middle stages can be played in any order.</desc>

		<desc>Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. 

In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.

In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.</desc>

		<name>Crackout</name>
		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Crackout is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

		<desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in 
their quest.

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

The character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.</desc>

		<desc>Willow is an action RPG based on the movie with the same name. The player assumes the role of Willow, the chosen one who must restore human form to the benevolent sorceress Fin Raziel and destroy the evil sorceress, Bavmorda. While the game follows the movie's plot somewhat most of the time, it also expands on it and introduces characters, races and enemies not found in the movie.

Gameplay is similar to other action RPGs and The Legend of Zelda. Willow is seen from a top down perspective and all enemies are visible on screen. Slaying enemies will give Willow experience points, which will eventually lead to him increasing his stats automatically. New weapons, shields and magic items are found in various treasure chests scattered across the land or given to Willow as part of the plot. Aside from battling minor enemies Willow will also face off against several boss monsters as well as characters from the movie.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

Stuck in the world of espionage among such groups as the FBI and the CIA, Golgo is constantly in mortal danger, and a lethal weapon in his own right. 

The Mafat Conspiracy is the sequel to the NES game Top Secret Episode. In this chapter, Golgo must track down a missing satellite from the SDI laser defense system, as well as rescue a top scientist and stop those who would use the satellite for blackmail and terror on the world's nations. 

While Golgo is outdoors, the game is a side-scrolling romp where the player can fire and jump. This changes when Golgo enters a building, at which point the game switches to a first person 3D maze. Navigating past soldiers and between floors, Golgo collects various clues to advance the storyline. There is also a driving sequence, and several sniper sequences in which precision aiming is required.</desc>

He can also charge his sword to fire a magical projectile. The real power-up, however, is that he can transform into a flying dragon. When this happens, the game turns into a shmup-style game in which the scrolling moves at a constant rate and the dragon can shoot fireballs in a spread formation. Transforming into a dragon is restricted by a power meter.

The game features six levels of action-- a snow level, a cave level, a water level, an industrial level, and a haunted castle level. The sixth and final level is fought entirely as a dragon with unlimited flight capability.</desc>

Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

The monsters of the game are also based on the Greek mythology and it is pretty entertaining to confront cyclopes, minotaurs and pegasuses.</desc>

Master Higgins embarks on an adventure to rescue the kidnapped dinosaurs and restore the peace of the island.

Adventure Island IV marks a notable departure from previous games in regards to the gameplay, ditching the linear arcade-style platforming in favor of a more open-ended, exploration-oriented game with light RPG elements, more closely resembling later games in the Monster World series.</desc>

You play as Captain America or Hawkeye. You must fight your way through various thugs to rescue Iron Man and Vision. This game is a side scroller, somewhat reminiscent of Bionic Commando in which you fight through a level then move to an overhead map to decide where to go next.

Captain America's attacks are: when he is standing, shield throw; when he is crouching, punch and when he is jumping, kick. Also, if you push twice in a direction, Cap can do a powerful forward charge with his shield for a short distance.

Hawkeye's attacks are all arrow shots. He can shoot left, right, up, upper-left or upper-right.

In battle mode, this is a two player, one-on-one battle. Player one chooses from Captain America or Hawkeye (the good guys) and player two chooses from Wizard, Ultron or Crossbones (the bad guys). You fight each other until one player has won three rounds.</desc>

In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.

Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk, crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that reverses gravity for a brief time.</desc>

		<name>Legendary Wings</name>
		<desc>Legendary Wings is an arcade shooter influenced by Greek mythology. A heroic figure from ancient times thrust into a strange futuristic world, you must fight your way through six levels to defeat "The Devil" and save the day.

The primary gameplay mode is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shooter similar to Xevious and 1943. Your main weapon is used to attack flying enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement, land-based enemies. Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these both improve your weapons and your resistance to damage (every "upgrade" is worth a free hit from enemies without dying).

Several secondary gameplay modes (Danger, Lucky, and Palace) are also triggered at key points in the vertical-scrolling mode. All of them are side-scrolling. The Danger stage requires you to face a gauntlet of enemies, while the Lucky stage is full of powerups, game continues, and other bonuses. The Palace stage is triggered when you defeat a mini-boss; you must get past the palace defenses before you can face the end-of-stage boss.</desc>

		<name>Akumajou Special - Boku Dracula-kun</name>
		<desc>Kid Dracula is an unusual side-scroller from Konami.  It's  a parody of the company's popular Castlevania series. Instead of playing as a member of the Belmont family, you play as young Kid Dracula.

You have been woken up from your sleep by the evil demon Garamos, who's been wrecking havoc in Dracula's Castle. It's up to you to stop him by traveling across several different locations, including Dracula's Castle, New York, the Sea, and Egypt!

Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action.  As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, such as turning into a bat, and different special attacks, such as a spread / homing attack. You can also spend the coins you get when you defeat enemies in one of several mini-games that show up when you're between levels.</desc>

		<path>./Dragon Warrior (USA) (Rev 1).zip</path>
		<name>Dragon Warrior</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior is the first famous console RPG. You assume the role of a descendant of Erdrick, a brave warrior of the past. Once upon a time, Erdrick defeated the evil Dragonlord with the help of the Ball of Light. Now, Dragonlord stole the Ball of Light, and your mission is to recover it and to restore peace in the world.

In Dragon Warrior, you move your character around in a top-down world. In cities and palaces you can talk to people, rest in inns and buy stuff in shops. There's a variety of weapons, equipment and armor to buy. 

When wandering around in the wilderness, you occasionally encounter enemies, and fight them from 1st person perspective. Combat is turn based: you select menu options while fighting - you can attack with your weapon, cast a spell (using up some of your magic energy), use and item or try to run. Killing monsters gives you experience, and, as is typical for RPGs, you level up and improve your stats when you gain enough experience. 

Like in later RPGs, you have limited hit points, lose them when you are attacked by enemies, and die when you run out of them. When your character dies in a battle, he is automatically restored in a nearby town.</desc>

The world lies in ruins, and the demons are ripping it apart. You control a group known as Devil Busters. Your mission is to prevent the demonic minions and their evil lord from dominating the entire planet.

In the beginning of the game, you create a party and allocate available skill points at your wish (upgrading strength, stamina, magic, etc.). When you level up, you can also distribute the gained points the way you like. Upon meeting a hostile creature, you can talk your way out of the battle or even convince a demon to fight for you. The game world is viewed partly from top-down perspective, and party from first-person perspective (in dungeons and battles).</desc>

		<name>Felix the Cat</name>
		<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

Dr. Wily has escaped from prison and is madder than ever, this time creating eight new Robot Masters of his own to take over the world and crush Mega Man! Is the world doomed?

In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world. As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself. Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.
This game introduces the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.</desc>

		<name>Rockin' Kats</name>
		<desc>Willy is a young jazz cat who goes by the name of "The Rockin' Kat". His girlfriend, Jill, was kidnapped by Mugsy, the local crime boss.

In this side scrolling game, you must help Rockin' Kat Willy to save his girlfriend through 7 stages. Each stage is a TV show broadcast through different channels of a TV set, and you must thus choose which channel you want to play.

		<desc>It's the robot revolt, and no one is safe! Mega Man is even less safe than anyone else. This time, our super-powered cybernetic friend is up against a horde of metal crazies who are sick and tired of obeying!

Mega Man 3 is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots.
It's the first time in a Mega Man that you can slide instead of merely walking and that you get a sidekick. Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it.
Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.</desc>

A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).  One of the first games on the NES to attempt to simulate large scale combat between different forces, although obviously in a very limited way.</desc>

		<desc>This is a platform game in the same fashion as Turtles II, that is that it's a sidescroller were you can move up and down on the screen, but you go on rollerskates. This makes the game go much faster than its counterpart, which adds difficulty and also a sense of speed.

It includes a silly story about three different roller skates gangs (somewhat like motor cycle gangs) in a close future, which is most an excuse for the game to exist.

You can choose between three different gangs, one is all-around, one is fast and weak (and consists of women) and one is slow and strong, you get the fashion. This adds some replayability, but in reality, they are kind of the same.

The game also suffers from trial and error; you must learn the courses if you want to master them. Luckily, the game has unlimited continues.</desc>

The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is the second Flintstones-licensed game for the NES. There are two characters you can play with. By pressing the Select button you can change from Fred to Barney and vice versa. Each character has unique abilities that are needed to complete certain parts of each stage. For example Fred can grab the edges of a roof or a hill and climb while Barney can hang from ropes and vines. In terms of weapons Fred has a bat which is stronger and can also be charged for extra power but it takes more time to use. Barney on the other hand has a slingshot and can shoot small rocks for ranged attacks but rather weak. There are also weapons like throwing axes and bowling balls that both can use.</desc>

In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that?s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game?s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don?t be surprised if she?s in another castle!</desc>

To protect the peace of the overworld, the two eldest Fuuma brothers fought the Dragon Master. Both were unable to defeat him and were killed, losing their legendary Wave Swords, also called Hadoukens. To avenge their deaths, the last of the Fuuma brothers vowed to slay the Dragon Master, and take back the Hadoukens.

Getsufuma Den is an action game with slight RPG elements. You travel through the overworld on pre-determined paths, which branch most of the time, leading you to shops, places where you can encounter other characters, and dungeons. Once you descend into a dungeon, you navigate your character on a platform, jumping and fighting enemies with your sword or other weapons. There are also a few first-person dungeons later in the game. In the dungeons you can collect money and then use it to buy weapons and other accessories on the overworld.</desc>

Jacky and Lee must fight their way into eight different castles in order to defeat the monsters and rescue the princess.

Chinese Hero is a top-down action game for one or two players, both playing on the same screen. Each ninja has the ability to move in any of four directions: up, down, left and right, as well as punch directly in front of them and do a "Moon Sault Kick" (which can be powered up to a "Miracle Kick") whereby they jump and somersault directly in front. Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named "Quick Passage Zone") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies, invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile attacks.</desc>

The rules of the World Video Boxing Association govern your bouts. Each match is three three-minute rounds long. Any boxer knocked down for a 10 count is Knocked Out (KO). If a boxer goes down three times, he'll find himself a Technical Knock Out (TKO). If both boxers make it to the end of the third round, the ref determines the winner.

Once you're in the ring you'll have to beat your opponent with smart fighting. Use left and right punches, as well as uppercuts to knock your opponent to the mat. Dodge your opponent's blows with some fancy footwork. Dazzle them with your brilliance and you'll be the World Video Boxing Association Champion. On the other hand, you might find yourself down for the count.</desc>

		<desc>In feudal Japan, an evil alien descends upon Murasame castle and takes over a giant statue, which then continues to spread its influence over four neighbouring castles. The samurai apprentice Takamaru is thus summoned to recapture the castles and then take on the alien itself.

Nazo no Murasamejou is a fast-paced action game that has some similarities with The Legend of Zelda, although it is faster and has none of the RPG/Adventure elements. It is also much more linear: You fight through the castles one after the other, with each stage consisting of the path to the castle and the castle itself, where the boss is waiting.

Your have two weapons: (unlimited) shurikens for ranged attacks and a sword for melee combat. The sword is automatically used when you are close enough to an enemy, and it can also be used to deflect enemy shurikens. But since you are constantly under attack by ninjas from all directions and also have only a limited time to finish each stage, the game is still quite hard.</desc>

		<name>Metal Slader Glory</name>
		<desc>Metal Slader Glory is a graphic adventure game where the player interacts with the protagonist's surrounding via a menu-based commands. The commands the player can choose varies between context, which usually ranges from talking to supporting characters to investigating the surrounding. The player must explore every possible option in order for new choices to appear. However, if the player makes a wrong selection, the game will end and the player must restart the game from where they left off. The player can quit at any point of the game and continue later via a password feature.
The game takes place eight years after a great war was waged between colonies in outer space, and peace has finally settled back onto the Earth. The main character, a 17-year-old war orphan named Tadashi Himukai, purchases a used worker-mech in order to start a construction business with his girlfriend, Elina Furfa. However, when he first activates it, the worker-mech disguise falls away, revealing a combat model Metal Slader, which were all supposedly dismantled after the war, and an enigmatic message is displayed in the cockpit: "EARTH IN PERIL... SEEK THE CREATOR". Prompted by this warning, Tadashi, his sister Azusa, and Elina head out into space to find the answers behind it.
It was the final game released by HAL Laboratory as an independent third-party developer before their buy-out by Nintendo. The game's story and character designs were done by manga artist Yoshimiru Hoshi, who loosely based the game on his 1984 manga Akûtensô Fixallia</desc>

		<name>Monster in My Pocket</name>
		<desc>The evil Warlock wants to take over the world! He calls his fellow monsters to join him, but several refuse - and after casting a shrinking spell that backfires and shrinks down all the monsters around him, transporting them to different homes in Los Angeles.

Warlock didn't let his size impairment get in the way of world domination, however, so it's up to The Vampire and The Monster to stop him! Along the way, both characters will have to fight through Warlock's henchmonsters through the streets, sewers, a construction area and even a Japanese garden.

The game features classic platforming action. The player only has one all-purpose attack and they can also double jump to avoid enemies or reach high ledges. The player can also pick up small objects and use them to attack several enemies at once. If there's only one player, they can choose between The Vampire or The Monster. Or if they don't want to go alone, a friend can join in and help them beat Warlock in the two player co-op mode.

The game is based on the Monster In My Pocket toy franchise. The package also included a limited edition Monster in My Pocket toy, Blemmyea (#81), which was only available with this game.</desc>

The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

But you can also upgrade your engine and tires - if you can afford it, which means you'll have to think seriously about gathering those dollar signs scattered on the track. The tracks themselves have more variety, some have unusual enemies (little planes bombing you from above), and more kinds of obstacles. You also have several lives and don't die immediately if you arrived last.</desc>

That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

Locked in a tower, she manages to write a plea for help on a scrap of paper and then sends a paper airplane out of her prison. Miraculously, it reaches her boyfriend Yanchamaru who, being the upstanding samurai that he is, immediately sets out to save her.

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 is the final sequel to Kid Niki and is a significant departure from the first two games. Not only does the game feature full four-way scrolling and large maps to explore, but Yanchamaru himself sports a completely new look and numerous new abilities. His trademark spinning sword now seems to more closely resemble a bo, and Yanchamaru can now use it to shoot waves of energy at foes, bounce on the end, spin in place, and even launch off of walls and corners. Taking a cue from Mega Man, he also now has the ability to slide through narrow spaces and underneath dangerous spikes.

Each stage contains numerous keys and locked doors. Any key will open any door, and it is possible to complete a stage without even finding all the keys and doors. The final door in each stage leads to the boss room. After clearing each stage, your performance is tallied, and depending on what you did, bonuses such as points or lives are given.</desc>

		<desc>The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.
nnPlayers start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates.</desc>

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

"Double Dragon II" ix essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, it discards the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. 
Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.</desc>

The game features 7 worlds each containing 5 stages (except for the 1st and 3rd world where each contain only 4 stages). Most of the game involves controlling Thrilla on a skateboard, dodging or jumping over various obstacles and enemies while attempting to get to the end of the stage. There will also be times when Thrilla will get to be on a surfboard, but gameplay remains the same as it was on the skateboard. Thrilla also rides a shark underwater with the goal still being to get to the end of the stage while either dodging enemies or throwing spears at them. There are also boss battles where Thrilla throws either coconuts or spears trying to deplete all the health of his adversary. 

There is also a shell game between stages which allows the player to obtain extra lives. The game also contains powerups throughout its levels such as a banana which restores health.</desc>

		<name>Mighty Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Capcom's only 8-bit port of the Final Fight series, Mighty Final Fight follows the storyline and characters of the first Final Fight game. Mayor of Metro City Mike Haggar, his ninja friend Guy and his daughter's boyfriend, Cody learn that Haggar's daughter, Jessica,  has been kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang whose leader has fallen in love with her, and also wants the meddling Mike Haggar to leave town. Now it's personal! Choosing one of the three fighters, the player embarks on a beat-em-up quest through the streets of Metro City.

The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and a one-player only game (unlike other Final Fight ports). Also exclusive to this particular Final Fight game is the experience system which allows gaining levels to learn additional moves, similar to the first Double Dragon game. The characters have all been squished down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move. Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an enemy.</desc>

As in other games in the series you can gain power-ups after defeating certain amounts of enemies by shooting the magical bells they leave behind, depending on the amount of times you shoot them, they change color and thus give different power-ups such as multiple shots, options, etc.

If correctly powered-up both ships can join-up to perform a screen-clearing attack, and you can choose your starting stage from any of the first four stages (the fifth and last remaining locked until you clear all the others).</desc>

		<desc>This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</desc>

Each level ends with a flagpole and the higher you grab it, the more points you score. Secret bonus areas and warp zones allow shortcuts through the game. A timeless classic that defined a genre.</desc>

		<name>Metal Storm</name>
		<desc>Metal Storm is an action game in which the player takes control of the giant mecha M-308 Gunner in order to put a stop to a malfunctioning computer menace. 

To save it from becoming another generic action game, innovation is shown through fast paced gameplay and the "gravity flip" ability, which enables the character to freely switch between moving along the floor or ceiling. While the game is only seven levels long, the difficulty ramps up quickly, so mastery of the gravity technique and memorization of the levels become absolute necessities for survival.</desc>

		<name>Little Samson</name>
		<desc>Ta-Keed, the Prince of Darkness, has managed to escape from his supernatural penitentiary where he has had centuries to plot exactly how he will take revenge on those that locked him away. Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. They must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.

Throughout the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters.
Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess.
Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts.
Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong.
K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not.</desc>

		<desc>The Dark Queen has attacked and kidnapped (toadnapped?) your best buddy.. To make matters worse, she nabbed the best looking girl around! So, what will you do? Cry? Whimper? Hide? Call the Starcops? NO! Cause you're a Battletoad! Battletoads don't cry, hide or call for help! And they certainly don't whimper! They get MAD then they get EVEN! So grab your blaster, hop on the Toadster and go get 'em!

You will control a battletoad through various levels. Some are side-scrolling beat-em-ups, other are vertical drops down a shaft, fighting as you go, others have you riding a rocket or surfboard, shooting or avoiding enemies. At the end of each area, there is a boss. In some areas, about half-way through, you may have a mini-boss.</desc>
