		<name>BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2</name>
		<desc>BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 is the direct sequel to the original F-Zero game released for the Super Famicom via the Satellaview. Two versions were released - a non-SoundLink game and a SoundLink game. The original non-SoundLink version was released as BSF-Zero 2 Practice on June 1, 1997 (although the title screen remained the same). It contained the four courses first seen throughout BS F-Zero Grand Prix (a Satellaview remake of the original), along with a new course called Mute City IV. Little is known about the later SoundLink version outside of surviving videos, but it was distributed in two halves in August 1997 and had a similar announcer and redone soundtrack as the previous Satellaview entry. At least the first week rearranged a few courses, and replaced two with new locations called "Forest I" and "Forest II". Presuming no areas were repeated, this likely means the SoundLink version had twice as many courses total. In addition, it can be seen that the player cannot choose between Grand Prix and Practice modes in the SoundLink version; as it was a live broadcast, the player is forced to play each course in a timed Practice mode, and then the Grand Prix race.</desc>

		<desc>Kirby's Toy Box is the translated name of a small series of Kirby sub-games titled (Kabi no Omochabako, meaning Kirby's Toy Box) in Japan. The Kirby's Toy Box series was broadcast over Nintendo's first form of digital distribution, the Satellaview satellite network, and, depending on when the player connected to the network, different games were available at different times. These could be downloaded to the Satellaview base unit, or an 8-megabit rewritable "Memory Pak" ROM cartridge compatible with the Satellaview. As these games did not use the SoundLink live audio streaming technology utilized by other Satellaview games, after being downloaded, they could be played at any time after the broadcast as long as they were not deleted or overwritten.</desc>

		<path>./BS Radical Dreamers (J) [T+Eng1.2_Demiforce].smc</path>
		<name>Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki</name>
		<desc>This text-based adventure (with some interesting background graphics) was originally released in Japan over the Satellaview system. The game is a spin-off from the Chrono Series, and was the precursor to Chrono Cross. It tells the story of Serge (travelling musician), Kid (thief), and Magil (wizard) as they attempt to steal the Frozen Flame from Viper Manor.  Contains multiple, often humorous endings. An interesting game for Chrono Trigger/Cross fans, as this was the game that Chrono Cross was essentially a remake of.

Gameplay is something between a standard text adventure and a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  Rather than having a full array of possible actions, players are limited to the several options it presents at any time.  With newly discovered items and information, new areas can be reached.  Occasionally battles will occur during the exploration, which are also handled by displaying several possible actions to choose between, such as "Run" or "Jump back as it swings!"</desc>

		<desc>BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge is an ura- or gaiden-version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Satellaview system featuring graphical enhancements similar to its Super Mario All-Stars version. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, some content has been rearranged and new content has been added. The game was released in four installments, in each of which the player is sent to a different SMB2 "World" to collect the Gold Mario Statues located in each level, defeat the boss, and then find and beat Wart, who can be battled in any world when going down in any vase while the player is in Subspace. The player can select the levels in any order and return to the levels as often as desired until the "episode" ends at around 50 minutes on the clock. The player starts the game as Mario, and character changing is forced in timed events. A points system was added. Points can be gained, among other things, by defeating enemies in various ways.</desc>

		<name>BS The Legend of Zelda - Ancient Stone Tablets</name>
		<desc>The events of Ancient Stone Tablets occur a mere six years after the destruction of Ganon by the hero, Link in A Link to the Past. Hyrule is enjoying a time of peace and tranquility, but Princess Zelda suffers from a dark, recurring dream showing a shadow over a temple; a premonition of evil to come. One day, she witnesses a mysterious and brilliant light in the sky to the east. Aginah, the younger brother of the wise man Sahasrahla and now living in his old hideout near the Eastern Palace also witnesses such a light, and travels to investigate. There he finds a strange youth lying on the ground. Zelda, also following the light, meets up with Aginah, and they both carry the child to rest in Sahasrahla's hideout. Confused by the youth's unusual clothes, they believe the child not to hail from Kakariko Village. Speaking to Aginah while the youngster sleeps, Zelda learns that his brother Sahasrahla had also sensed danger surrounding Hyrule and had left the land to find the hero, Link. While Link has not yet returned, Zelda senses that if this new youth was endowed with courage, he or she may be the Hero of Light.Ancient Stone Tablets is different from most other Zelda games as the game's central heroes are actually the avatars of the player's ID for the BS-X Broadcasting System, drawn into Hyrule, which is also true for BS The Legend of Zelda. The difference being that this time the player does not take the place of Link, but takes part in a new tale set after the events of A Link to the Past. The male character wears a green tunic</desc>

One difference is the fact that the player can pick up coins along the racetrack (which do nothing besides adding to the score).

Now for the first time each character has unique abilities and attacks, furthermore each character has a charging attack that can be used to energize your partner thus encouraging teamplay in the two-player cooperative mode.</desc>

		<desc>BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge is an ura- or gaiden-version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Satellaview system featuring graphical enhancements similar to its Super Mario All-Stars version. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, some content has been rearranged and new content has been added. The game was released in four installments, in each of which the player is sent to a different SMB2 "World" to collect the Gold Mario Statues located in each level, defeat the boss, and then find and beat Wart, who can be battled in any world when going down in any vase while the player is in Subspace. The player can select the levels in any order and return to the levels as often as desired until the "episode" ends at around 50 minutes on the clock. The player starts the game as Mario, and character changing is forced in timed events. A points system was added. Points can be gained, among other things, by defeating enemies in various ways.</desc>

		<name>New Yatterman - Nandai Kandai Yajirobee</name>
		<desc>New Yatterman: Nandai Kandai Yajirobee is a multiplayer-focused game for the Super Famicom that is based on the 1970s Yatterman anime franchise.

Yatterman features a team of three heroes, all called Yatterman, who attempt to beat the supervillain team Doronbo (also a group of three) to a set of skull coins which will reveal the way to a giant treasure horde. The heroes often use toys and mechs to defeat their incompetent opponents, such as the male protagonist's kendamagic.

The game is similar to First Star's Spy vs. Spy series, in that both teams are attempting to reach the treasure first. They can trip up their opponents via a number of traps, some of which have conditional uses. By burying mines and setting off missiles, the player can whittle down the health of their opponents as well as keep them off their tracks. If the two teams meet, they fight each other in a three-on-three tag team battle with the losing side taking a large hit to their health. The game can be played single-player (as either the Yatterman team or the Doronbo team) or multiplayer.</desc>

		<name>Special Tee Shot</name>
		<desc>BS Special Tee Shot is a game that was planned to be released on the SNES, though eventually was just made exclusively for the Super Famicom's Satellaview service. The game was later retooled and made into the game that is known as Kirby's Dream Course. It is unknown why the game was remade to feature Kirby characters, though it's presumed that it as because Nintendo thought that the game would prove more successful with a well known brand behind it.
The Satellaview video game had unique characters rather than already developed ones. Overall, however, the player character was uninspiring as it was simply just a red sphere that bounced around. Despite the fact that the game would be remade to feature Kirby characters, there are dramatic differences between the two titles, including the overall gameplay concept and levels. For example, in this game, the goal was simply to shoot the ball in the hole, while in the Kirby game you want to crash into enemies to destroy them. However, despite this, the games still share many similarities, such as graphics and the overall way the player controls the ball.

Interestingly, Special Tee Shot was featured not only in magazines but also on the back of SNES packages as advertisements before ultimately being cancelled and brought back with Kirby characters. It should also be noted that before being titled Kirby's Dream Course, the game was officially called Kirby's Tee Shot.</desc>
