		<name>Chronos Twins</name>
		<desc>When a mysterious alien being arrives on planet Skyla, the planet's inhabitants tried to make peace with it.  However, its intentions were anything but... destroying all in its wake and forcing the planet's inhabitants to flee as none of their weapons could even harm it.  Study revealed that the alien was able to exist in two different times simultaneously, and could only be harmed in both.  A special time machine was built - one that can transport someone into the past and the present at the same time...

Chronos Twin is a side-scrolling platform game with a difference - the action takes place on both Nintendo DS screens simultaneously.  The top screen shows the player in the present, while the touch screen shows the player in the past.  Pressing the A Button will make both the past and present player jump simultaneously.  While there are certain differences in the past and the present (for example, a platform in the past may not exist in the present), as long as the player is standing on the platform in one time period, they won't fall.

The player also has a weapon at their disposal - a gun which can be fired in the present with the X Button, and the past with the B Button.  However - the gun cannot be fired in both time periods simultaneously.  The gun can also be charged up by holding down the button, releasing a more powerful blast.

After a certain point in the game, the player is also able to stop time in one period while moving about freely in another period.  This can be used to move blocks to allow both present and past players to get through, or to release platforms that a player in one time period couldn't reach.</desc>

		<desc>Asterix at the Olympic Games  is licensed from the comic and live action film of the same name. In this sports game the player controls Asterix, Obelix or Dogmatix (Idéfix in most countries) from the French comic series Astérix le Gaulois.

Unlike the version for Windows, Wii, Playstation 2 and Xbox 360, which is a full fledged 3D action adventure game combined with minigames, the Nintendo DS version focuses completely on the minigames. The plot, combat sequences and puzzle solving have been removed from the game.

The game does comes with 120 different Olympic challenges. The challenges are divided in 4 categories: Roman, Greek, Gallic and Egyptian. Each challenged is played by rubbing the stylus over the touchpad in a certain way or in a few cases blowing into the microphone. Challenges range from actual Olympic sports like disc throwing to children's games like hula hoops. Players need to obtain at least a bronze medal to continue to the next challenge.</desc>

To make sure customers are satisfied, players have to use their gaming skills. Salon owners use the Nintendo DS-Touchpen to click on stars to perfect their customers' make-up, copy designs for body painting or give the best possible massage by drawing the right sequence of lines onscreen in the required time. The end of each chapter presents an even bigger challenge, featuring a client with special individual requests, such as an elderly lady who needs to get styled up for a date with her online acquaintance. With each task successfully solved, players gather points. These can then be invested in new furnishings such as a brand new photo studio or a high-tech massage table.</desc>

		<desc>Similar to The Incredible Machine the player needs to use animated parts to assemble a Rube Goldberg-type contraption and solve puzzles by doing so.

The game features three different modes: Classic, Arcade or Construction Kit. The classic mode requires the player to place the parts and manually activate the machine to get the ball to it's goal, the arcade mode confronts the player with an already finished and running machine which needs a little help. By using the stylus or blowing into the microphone the player not only moves the ball through the experiment but also activates and uses the parts of the machine. By successfully completing all those puzzles, the player unlocks additional components which are then at his disposal in the construction kit to freely construct anything he wants without a time or space limit.

Although the game doesn't feature a traditional multiplayer-mode, the players can trade their experiments with friends over the wireless connection.</desc>

		<name>Deal or No Deal</name>
		<desc>Deal or No Deal is based on the TV game show of the same name. It puts one contest against a banker. At the start of the game, the player choose one of the 26 briefcases. They contain prize money ranging from $.01 to $1,000,000. The different amounts are shown on a game board. Each round the player has to open a number of the remaining briefcases which are then marked on the board (six in the first round, five in the second, four in the third). Based on the remaining amount of money, the banker offers the player a deal, a certain amount of money, based on odds. The player can choose to accept the deal when large sums are gone, or decide to go through. After the third round the briefcase is opened and if it contains a higher sum than what the banker offered, the player has made a great deal.

In singleplayer, three modes are available: TV Game (classic gameplay), Vault Game (Find the 3-number combination to a vault in the correct order in as few turns as possible. The initial prize is $500,000 and each turn the prize fund is reduced.) and High Low (Pick a briefcase and then make a calculated guess if the next briefcase will contain a higher or lower sum. For each correct guess, the prize money is increased). Two-player multiplayer offers Head to Head (classic gameplay to get the best deal) or Best Deal where one of the players becomes the banker.

Gameplay consists solely of picking numbers and calculated guesses. No other interactive game elements are present.</desc>

Based on the remaining amount of money, the banker offers the player a deal, a certain amount of money, based on odds. The player can choose to accept the deal when large sums are gone, or decide to go through. After the third round the briefcase is opened and if it contains a higher sum than what the banker offered, the player has made a great deal.

In singleplayer, three modes are available: TV Game (classic gameplay), Vault Game (Find the 3-number combination to a vault in the correct order in as few turns as possible. The initial prize is $500,000 and each turn the prize fund is reduced.) and High Low (Pick a briefcase and then make a calculated guess if the next briefcase will contain a higher or lower sum. For each correct guess, the prize money is increased). Two-player multiplayer offers Head to Head (classic gameplay to get the best deal) or Best Deal where one of the players becomes the banker.

Gameplay consists solely of picking numbers and calculated guesses. No other interactive game elements are present.</desc>

The game takes football to the streets of numerous locations all around the world and features 18 international teams and a selection of more than 250 star players. The game can be played with either buttons, or the for the DS unique stylus control. Movement is done with the control pad, all other actions can be done with the stylus. Shooting is done by sliding the stylus towards the goal, while passes are made by touching in the direction of a team mate. When defending a slide is used for tackling. 

Doing tricks is a central part of the series and this DS iteration is no different with a number of different moves. These are done by combining different stylus slides. For each successful trick, the player is awarded trick points that increases his gamebreaker meter. Once full the gamebreaker can be triggered. The gamebreaker is a sort of quick time event where the player has to touch the touch screen when an icon appears. When successful this will lead to a goal. When the opposition gets a gamebreaker, the player can counter it by touching the screen faster. 

In addition to standard friendly matches the game also features a street challenge mode and a kick ups mode. In street challenge the player has to complete events to earn a reputation. To get a high reputation for the player not only needs to win, but to do it with a team with good chemistry so that the team performs as a group. By being successful in the street challenge the player earns unlockables. The kick ups mode is a rhythm action mini game where the player has to touch the screen in rhythm with the music. The game is also playable in multiplayer for two players through wireless connection.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
		<desc>In 2006, Final Fantasy III reached North American shores in an official update/remake for the Nintendo DS, finally bringing all of the main Final Fantasy entries to the United States for the first time.

Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.

Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro, improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new backstories.

Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IV</name>
		<desc>Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as  Final Fantasy II in the West. 

Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.

It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc. 

Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.</desc>

		<name>Football Academy - Build and Prove Your Football K</name>
		<desc>Football Academy is a mix of a football trivia game and a card game. In it the player gets to enter the academy where he under the supervision of former Chelsea and Portugal manager Luiz Felipe Scolari gets to create his own team and test his knowledge about the sport. When starting out at the academy the player gets two packs of cards with footballers. Once the player has picked his starting eleven out of these he will be able to go to the stadium and compete against unlocked teams. Victory in matches and the player is awarded badges, trophies and better card packs that allows him to improve his team. 

The player can't go directly to the stadium however. First he must prove his knowledge about game at the classroom. Here the player gets to take a Football IQ test consisting of three mini games. The accumulated points from the mini games is the player's football IQ which determines how good footballers the player can acquire. Early on the player only has access to bronze packs but by defeating teams in the stadium silver and gold packs will be unlocked. The test can be redone at any time but first it might be wise for the player to practice the mini games on the training pitch. 

Once the player has a team it is time to go to the changing room and manage it. Here the player gets to pick a formation and a starting eleven. Each footballer has a number of attributes such as position, nation and skill rating. The team also has a chemistry rating which is based on the footballers' home country as well as their preferred position and formation. Therefore it's important not only to pick the best ones, but also makes sure that they fit with their team mates.

The actual matches of the game are played similarly to manager games such as Championship Manager where the player only gets to see an overview of the action. The tactical possibilities available are more limited here as the only options available are where to attack (left, right or center) and the mentality of the team (push up, sit back or balanced). What special however is that at different times throughout the matches the player will face dribbling, passing and shooting battles. Here one of the footballers will face one of the opponents. Before the battle the footballers' ratings are recalculated based on their mentality, chemistry and energy. Then each player gets to choose one of two actions and depending on if he is successful or not the footballer's rating increases or decreases. The footballer with the highest rating wins the battle. Being successful leads to more and more battles until a goal scoring opportunity appears. 

Football Academy has support for two player multi-card play. The players can test out their teams against each other but it is also possible to trade footballers.</desc>

		<name>Giana Sisters DS</name>
		<desc>Giana Sisters DS is a modern 2009 remake of the cult game The Great Giana Sisters from the year 1987. The original game appeared on the C64 and Amiga, but had to be pulled from the shelves after Nintendo threatened to sue over similarities to the Super Mario games. Surprisingly, more than 20 years later the sisters make an appearance on the Nintendo DS.

Giana Sisters DS is a classic platformer. Giana is caught in a dream world and must now recover her lost diamonds and find a way to the mysterious castle. The game features more than 80 new levels (i.e. is not a one-to-one remake). There are also new special items that make use of the features of the DS. Giana can, for example, collect a bubble gum item that can be activated using the touch screen. The bubble enables Giana to fly and is controlled by blowing into the microphone. Another new feature is a world map that allows the player to select and replay levels.</desc>

		<name>Glory Days 2</name>
		<desc>Glory Days 2 takes the premise of Choplifter! and cranks it up a few notches. A strategic component was added that melds old gameplay with new game concepts. There are a lot of playable vehicles that become unlocked as you advance in the game.

The overall goal of the game is to provide air support for your ground troops as they advance and capture enemy bunkers, ultimately pushing them back enough that they retreat. Players can choose from three aviators and there are sixteen missions in total, moving on in time from classic WWII aircraft to modern day helicopters and F14's.

The strategical component allows the player to take command of ground units and manage funds to build new units. These funds are acquired by completing missions such as saving civilians or capturing bases. Progressively, more powerful units and weapons become available. Multiplayer is supported for up to eight players over Wi-Fi, split into two cooperative teams where the enemy's command centre needs to be taken out. The setup of the battles is completely customizable for different parameters.

Optionally, 3D glasses are supported to add more depth to the action on the screens.</desc>

Players use the stylus to draw shapes 'magical runes' on the DS touch screen, which then travel towards your opponent on the other side of the playing area. In the playing area is a circular drawing board on which you draw runes that activate your spells, assuming there is currently enough mana to do so. Once cast, a little icon starts moving anti-clockwise around the board, up towards an image of the opponent (at the 12 o'clock position). If it hits your opponent the effects of the spell are manifested, whether it's simply inflicting damage, cursing them with effects. 

Both players players have a shield which can be activated by pressing their own icon (at the six o'clock position). The shield only last few a few seconds before needing to recharge and some spells are able to cut through it, so players need to keep an eye on not only which spells are traveling towards them, but how their spells are likely to be received by their opponent. Tactics are used to combine these runes both in timing and effect.</desc>

		<desc>Inazuma Eleven 2: Firestorm is a role-playing sports game that was released for Nintendo DS at the same time as the game Inazuma Eleven 2: Blizzard in Europe and Japan. 
 
In this game you play as a football keeper, who plays for his school football team, winner of the last Football Frontier. However, an alien football team, the Gemini Storm, wants to destroy all the schools. So, as the player one starts going around all through Japan to look for new players to beat the Gemini Storm in a football match. When one reaches the city of Nara, you find out that the Prime Minister was kidnapped, and you'll have to face a football match with a team of undercover agents to save said Prime Minister. Afterward, when traveling to the city of Alpine, you will find the character Shawn Froste, who will help you in defeating the Gemini Storm. 
 
In the game you take control of Mark, the football keeper, in the overworld, where you can collect items, improving yourself with training or taking part in random encounters. On the Inazuma Bus, you can recruit players for your team, restore your FP (Fitness Points) and TP (Technical Points), or travel to the different regions of Japan. 
The matches are controlled with the stylus, and when you run into an opposing player, you start a duel which determines the possession of the ball. You can also use special abilities.</desc>

		<name>Inazuma Eleven</name>
		<desc>Inazuma Eleven is a blend of a football (soccer) game and traditional RPG. The game stars Mark Evans, the captain and goalkeeper of Raimon Junior High School's football team. However, it seems that he is the only one who cares about playing as his teammates prefer to waste time in the clubroom. Because of that their club is the laughing stock of the whole school and on the verge of being disbanded. The team is given one last chance in winning a friendly match against one of the best teams. When all seems lost, there appears a transfer student and well-known player ? Axel Blaze. The team now has hopes for winning, but there are others that, for some reason, don't want the club to exist. 
 
The game is divided into classic top-down exploration, during which the player walks around and interacts with NPCs, and real-time football matches. The matches play out in real-time and are controlled only with the stylus. All of the teammates on the field move automatically with the player being able to manually draw or point to their destination. Encountering a rival or enemy goal, the game pauses and the player is able to choose his action. These consist of standard moves and anime-styled supernatural skills. 
 
As in any RPG, teammates gain levels and improve their statistics, which affect the way they perform and the outcome of their actions. The team is fully customizable with your teammates' position on the field and hundreds additional players among whom to recruit new ones from.</desc>

		<name>Jewel Match</name>
		<desc>This is the Nintendo DS release of the well-received match-3 game Jewel Match for Windows/Macintosh. Due to the limited screen size of the handheld, the grid size of the levels had to be cut down from 14x14 to 12x12 tiles, thus forcing a complete redesign of all the levels. While at it the developers added some DS-only gameplay options like the new magical storm where the player can blow into the microphone to reshuffle the jewels. 

The basic idea of Jewel Match comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - the player is presented with a grid of jewels. By swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, rows of three or more identical jewels can be formed that will disappear instantly, giving points to the player and making room for other gems falling from above to take their place. The levels have gaps and shaped areas, though, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can fall diagonally.

Jewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each of the 150 levels, a selection of squares have gold or even silver backings. One match (gold) or two (silver) must be created over each of these against a ticking clock to clear the level. Later in the game there are jewels tied to their square with a golden or silver chain, which thus are not falling down and blocking empty squares beneath them. These jewels can be freed by matching them once or twice, too, which means that the most difficult squares must be matched four times (silver chain and silver background) to be cleared.

A succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a particular jewel, the second not only removes the gem but also any effects (background or chains) on the square, and the final one removes all gems of that colour. Another extra to be unlocked is a magical storm that will have the player blow into the DS microphone to mix up the jewels. Moreover, matching more than three jewels in a row will create gems with special powers. Matching four will create a joker gem while matching five gives a gem that, once activated, will destroy the whole row it is in. 

The game also offers a hot seat mode where two players can play the same level right after another, competing for the better clearing time.</desc>

		<name>Jigapix : Wonderful World</name>
		<desc>In Jigapix: Wonderful World jigsaw puzzle fans take on the addictive challenge of solving 80 landscape puzzles created from picturesque and iconic images sampled from around the world. Puzzles images included in the game come from eight different regions, as well as eight different sizes, making piecing images together more and more challenging as familiarity with regions fade and the dimensions of puzzles change. Players can solve the puzzles alone or with a friend via a wireless connection, and for those needing an occasional break from jigsaw play, there are three additional mini-games included in the game. Finally, DSi owners can take the game to a whole new level as they are able to snap photos and create their own personalized jigsaw puzzles out of the imported images.</desc>

The touch screen displays the melody at the top that you must follow, and the three bars below represent the different note 'types' that you can play - either by tapping, or by sliding the stylus along the note (depending on the difficulty level).  Based on the accuracy of the note press, you'll be awarded "GOOD", "KIRA²" "RAINBOW", or "MISS" if you fail to hit it.

A story mode is included, where the player progresses by completing songs and unlocking new ones for play.  They also earn money, which can be used to purchase clothes and accessories for their in-game avatar to wear.  There are also photo booths where the avatar can pose in a variety of ways for the camera.</desc>

		<desc>The handheld Nintendo versions of LEGO The Lord of the Rings (based on Peter Jackson's film trilogy, and in turn based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books) follow the same storyline as its home console cousins, where players must help Frodo Baggins and his friends travel from their peaceful home in the Shire to the perilous Mount Doom to destroy a powerful ring created by the antagonistic Sauron. 
 
Like various LEGO games, players control a variety of characters using the control pad (as well as the 3DS Circle Pad) across several levels in an open-world environment, completing a set of quests along the way. Players also need to utilise special items like the Light of Eärendil, Elven rope and a wide arrange of weaponry to defeat several enemies (especially in the dark region of Mordor). 
 
Unlike previous LEGO games, character biographies are also scattered throughout the levels that give players general summaries for each unique character. Red Bricks are also scattered and can unlock special abilities with the Extras menu. 
 
While the slapstick humour is absent in these games, the 3DS and DS versions still retain the family-friendly approach as the home console versions.</desc>

		<name>Monster Puzzle</name>
		<desc>Fairy Tale World is in trouble!  With less and less children reading fairy tales, people will forget the stories and Fairy Tale World will disappear forever.  The monsters who feature in all of the fairy tale stories don't like this at all, so they take it upon themselves to rescue their world.

Monster Puzzle is a puzzle game similar to Zoo Keeper or Bejeweled.  You have a set grid of monsters that can be dragged with the stylus either left and right or up and down (up to a maximum of three spaces).  If you match at least three monsters horizontally or vertically, that row of monsters will disappear.  If you match up a 2x2 square of monsters, a 4x4 square of monsters will be deleted.

Unlike Zoo Keeper and Bejeweled, the goal is not to just eliminate monsters.  Instead, players must 'claim' spaces where the monsters lie, which is done when you clear a set of monsters.  In most stages, you will just need to claim the space once (which turns it orange), but in later stages, you will need to claim space twice (which turns orange spaces to red).  After a certain percentage of space is claimed, the player moves onto the next stage.

The game can also be played in versus mode with a friend.  In this mode, the player who runs out of time first is the loser.  Time can be added by continuing to clear monsters.  If you clear multiple monsters simultaneously, a rock will appear on the opponent's screen which makes it more difficult for them to clear monsters.</desc>

Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title, the main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.

The player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.

The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the  combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.

The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.

New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.</desc>

The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains from the comic book mythos.

One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When Spider-Man's "Rage" meter builds up, the black suit automatically takes over, allowing Spider-Man to become faster, aggressive, and more powerful.</desc>

They fought together against the Separatist movement during the Clone Wars, but are now on opposing sides during the Galactic Civil War. X2 regrets his part in the execution of Order 66, the killing of his former commander, Jedi Master Ferroda. He turned his back at the Empire and, after hiding out for a while, joined the Rebel Alliance. His brother, an Imperial Officer, is now trying to hunt him down for his desertion.</desc>

Wickie carries a slingshot, but that is not enough to defeat the more powerful enemies. Instead, he must rely on tricks and traps such as pushing boulders towards enemy patrols. There are five different game worlds that lead Wickie into different corners of Europe. Short cut scenes with the characters from the animated series tell the story in-between the levels.

		<desc>Youda Safari est un jeux de gestion du temps qui mettra les joueurs en charge des parcs naturels successifs à travers le monde, donnant aux gestionnaires en herbe la mission de développer attentivement chaque parc pour en faire des destinations spectaculaires qui attirent des foules croissantes de visiteurs virtuels à mesure qu'ils grandissent. 
Sur Youda Safari, les joueurs jouent le rôle de Lucy, une directrice des relations publiques et du marketing entreprenante, qui a accepté d'aider son amie à gérer des parcs de safari dans de nombreux endroits et continents, notamment aux Etats-Unis, en Europe, en Russie, en Afrique, en Chine et au Brésil. Les joueurs doivent combiner la gestion du temps et la prise de décision sage pour s'assurer que les visiteurs enthousiastes et les touristes passionnés d'animaux ont les meilleurs itinéraires possibles pour voir leurs animaux préférés et prendre quelques photos. Au fur et à mesure que les joueurs progresseront, ils devront décider comment améliorer chaque parc, que ce soit en y ajoutant de nouvelles attractions animales et des véhicules de tourisme, ou en construisant des installations touristiques plus grandes et plus de restaurants. Les futurs propriétaires de parcs devront peaufiner chaque parc pour offrir les meilleures excursions et aventures de la faune s'ils veulent que leurs clients reviennent.</desc>
