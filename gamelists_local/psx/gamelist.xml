		<desc>One fine and sunny day in the land that Buddies roam, there was a great and mighty disco in a tent. This tent would bob up and down with the music. All of a sudden, a large, flat, grey, flying THING blocked out the sun (The Great Eclipse) and began to drop crates. These crates were filled with all sorts of goodies such as Uzis and Bazookas. Inevitably, chaos broke out and the buddies became segregated according to color.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness</name>
		<desc>Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness is a combination of classic Pac-Man (or in this case, Ms. Pac-Man) action, maze exploration and Sokoban-like puzzle elements. Players take on the role of Ms. Pac-Man and have to save Pac-Land once again. Although the game is in full 3D, players can only move along designated paths.

The four Wonders, mystical regions separated from the rest of Pac-Land by force fields, contains four Gems of Virtue: Generosity, Truth, Wisdom and Courage, each holding enough power to help keep Pac-Land safe from evil. However, an unknown enemy has transformed the Enchanted Castle into a haunted house, in turn starting a chain reaction of evil all around Pac-Land and the four Wonders. It is up to Ms. Pac-Man to enter the 3D designed worlds of the four Wonders and put the evil to rest for good.</desc>

		<desc>After receiving a distress call from the Bravo Team, an elite group from S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad) flew into the desolate Raccoon City. Apparently, the team had uncovered something concerning the Umbrella corporation -- a biotech research company. But then, without warning, the Bravo Team vanished into thin air.
 Upon landing in the small city, the members of S.T.A.R.S began to investigate. They heard some strange noises coming from the surrounding woods and realized the sounds were getting closer. Scared, they took off running and kept on until they came to a large, ominous mansion. Seeking safety they entered, locking the door behind them. Their adventure had just begun.</desc>

Enter a world where love knows no bounds, the evil is neverending and good can overcome all if the heart is just and true. Featuring three battle modes, the ability to master skills to create items and an emotional level for each of the characters, Enix has pulled out all the stops in their latest (and first) title to be brought to the North American PlayStation.

Claude, having recently been commissioned as an Ensign in the Earth Federation, is given his first mission under the supervision of his father. This first mission is to survey the planet Milocinia, where a mysterious energy field appears. Once they arrive, they find an alien ruin, filled with mostly broken machinery. Finding a mysterious device in the center of it, Claude begins to examine it close-up, despite orders to keep away from it. As he approaches, the machine activates, teleporting him to Expel.</desc>

		<desc>A twinkling consciousness became a star that sparkled in the night and banished the darkness. The Mana Goddess acquired consciousness by gazing into the light of that sun. She made Fa´Diel, a great land, but so far an empty one.

In Legend of Mana you control a hero or heroine traveling over the land of Fa’Diel. The game features a land creation system, allowing you to create new locations and story elements by placing mysterious artifacts. Those ancient artifacts are repositories of the land´s long-forgotten memories and the many events that once took place there. As the game advances, you will receive more artifacts and find out more about the land. At home you can raise pet monsters and create powerful golems, forge mighty weapons or refine musical instruments. On your adventures you can meet various interesting characters and fight against gruesome monsters.

The game is extremely non-linear in terms of gameplay. You can explore areas in any order and play through 67 related scenarios. Eventually you will resurrect the Mana Tree and discover the Legend of Mana.</desc>

		<name>LSD : Dream Emulator</name>
		<desc>In LSD the player navigates through a psychedelic dream world. The idea is simply to walk around and explore things in a dream environment. There are many strange environments in this world, and one way to travel through them is by foot. However, if the player bumps into walls or other objects in the game, they will be transported to another environment instantaneously through a system called "linking". Bumping into people, animals, or special objects usually results in a stranger dream.

Each dream can last up to 10 minutes, after which the player will 'wake up', when the screen fades away and the player is sent back to the game's initial menu. However, if the player falls off a cliff or into a hole in the dream, then the player will wake up immediately. There is a graph that appears at the end of each dream that keeps track of the player's state of mind; the states are Upper, Downer, Static and Dynamic, as referring to the environments and the general feel of the dream the player just went through. Past states may have effects on later dreams.</desc>

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

		<path>./Tobal No. 1 (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Tobal No. 1</name>
		<desc>Tobal No. 1 is a fighting game for the PlayStation developed by DreamFactory and published by Square in 1996. The game was DreamFactory's first release, as well as Square's first release on the CD-based console.
 Tobal No. 1 marks Square's incursion into the fighting game genre, although an adventure-like quest mode is part of the game. The game's mechanics were designed with the aid of fighter game designer Seiichi Ishii, while all the characters were designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame. The sequel, Tobal 2, was never released in North America and Europe.
 Packaged with both the North American and Japanese version of the game was a sampler disc featuring a pre-release demo of Final Fantasy VII and video previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and SaGa Frontier.
 STORY:
 Tobal No. 1 takes place in the year 2027 on a fictional planet called Tobal, which has large deposits of Molmoran, an ore that can be used as an energy source. The planet's 98th tournament is held to determine who has the rights to the ore. A number of humans and aliens compete for the title. The game's plot and character backstories are only explored in the instruction manual. All of the initial eight playable characters receive the same ending.
 The game's immediately playable characters include Chuji Wu, Oliems, Epon, Hom, Fei Pusu, Mary Ivonskaya, Ill Goga, and Gren Kutz. Bosses include Nork, Mufu, and the emperor Udan. All bosses are unlockable after defeating them in Dungeon Mode except Nork. Instead, the game allows the player to select Snork (Small Nork), a pint-sized version of the very large character. There is also one secret fighter named Toriyama Robo (named for Akira Toriyama) who is unlockable if the player can complete the 30-floor Udan's Dungeon level in the quest mode. Toriyama Robo is not seen at any point in the game except at the very end of the dungeon.
 GAMEPLAY:
 Tobal No. 1 has various gameplay modes including a tournament mode, two player versus mode, practice mode, and the unique quest mode, all of which utilize the same fighting system. The game itself runs at up to a smooth 60 frames per second due to its lack of textured polygons and reduced details which gave the game a distinctive look in comparison to other fighting games at the time, such as Tekken 2. The game's controls are unique in that they allow full freedom of movement in the ring as long as the player faces the opponent. The player has the ability to dash and jump, and certain buttons execute high, medium, and low attacks for each character. Tobal No. 1 also has an intuitive grappling and blocking system, offering the player a variety of throws and counter moves.
 Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Tobal No. 1 is the "Quest Mode", which combines the game's fighting controls with three-dimensional dungeon exploration. The player must advance down a number of floors, contend with traps, and engage in fights with a variety of enemies including the game's playable characters. Several items can be found, dropped by enemies, or bought using crystals. These items can be picked up, consumed, or thrown at enemies, and include foodstuffs that can restore the player's HP or potions that have a range of effects including raising the player's maximum health or bringing it down to 1 point. There is no way to save one's progress, and dying means starting over from the beginning. Defeating certain characters in this mode unlocks them as playable characters in the game's other modes.
 Each of the eight initially playable characters can perform high, medium, and low attacks, and the game makes use of a grappling and blocking system that lets players execute a variety of throws and counterattacks.
 Features:
 Featuring such modes of play as "Tournament," "Vs.," and "Quest"
 Kick, punch, guard, jump, dash, and attack your way through the darkness of a dungeon to locate the Molmoran
 Select from 11 different characters including Emperor Udan, Nork, Hom, Epon, and Oliems</desc>

		<name>G. Darius</name>
		<desc>G-Darius revolves around a conflict between the humanoids of Amnelia and cyborg/chimera biovessels known as the "Thiima" (meant to mean simply "bringers of death"). The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots "Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen" are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.</desc>

However, humans quickly began to fear and distrust Repliforce's military power and their methods of fighting Mavericks proved to be very destructive with little disregard for human life. One day, the floating city Sky Lagoon was under attack by Mavericks and Repliforce arrived on the scene after the city has crash landed on the ground, where one of their leaders, Colonel, was being ordered by the Maverick Hunters X and Zero to lower his weapons for questioning as suspects for the incident. Out of pride and contempt towards human government, Colonel refused to comply, and following the accusations behind the Sky Lagoon incident, the Repliforce General decided stage a coup d'état, seeking to create a new utopia just for Reploids. Repliforce were then labeled as Mavericks by the government, thus the Maverick Hunters must fight against their former allies and stop their coup.</desc>

		<desc>The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!

PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.

Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!

The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</desc>

		<desc>Vandal Hearts is a turn-based strategy RPG. It follows a fixed plot-line with set battles, focusing more on strategic elements than adventure elements. 

The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas).

In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment for the up coming battles.</desc>

To prove its efficiency and safety, he decides to serve as the very first guinea-pig for its maiden voyage. However, by the time the machine returned, he isn't anywhere inside. The only thing that returned with it is a talking parrot, along with a large gemstone called the Dynamond, which is seemingly the most powerful and valuable jewel in the world.
 Now it is up to a search party, founded by Dr. Kieda's lab assistant Tanpei, to travel though time to find Dr. Kieda; but it seems that someone power hungry is looking for the "Dynamond"...
 In Time Bokan Bokandesuyo the player controls "The Skull Trio" (Marjo, Grocky &amp; Walther) using different kind of vehicles, bombs and power-ups in a vertical 2d shooter game.</desc>

		<desc>Aya Brea is back in a new game. This time there are fewer RPG elements than the first game, and the game plays more like Resident Evil. Battles are now in real-time, and a new range of weapons are available. Defeating enemies rewards money as well as points used to revive and power-up Aya's suppressed Parasite powers, like healing and igniting foes. Weapons and armor now have fixed stats, but attachments can be swapped in and out of them to modify their properties.

After surviving the events of Parasite Eve Aya left her job as a cop and became a member of MIST (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Agency) in order to hunt down the remnant mutants spawned by Eve's awakening. In the year 2000 a new breed of Neo Mitochondrion takes over the Akropolis Tower in downtown LA. Aya is called in and uncovers a secret organization that threatens all humanity.</desc>

		<desc>Front Mission 3 is the third main entry and the fifth entry overall in the Front Mission series. Like other Front Mission titles, Front Mission 3 is part of a serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their struggles involving mecha known as wanzers.
While it is a tactical role-playing game, there is a stronger emphasis on role-playing elements as opposed to strategic elements in Front Mission 3. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. New to Front Mission 3 is the Double Feature Scenario - this allows the player to experience two different scenarios that exist independently of one another within the game's storyline. In other words, the player can play through two stories; while they may share common events and environments, the stories are largely unique and in essence are fully-fledged games.</desc>

The perception that the French have simply let Hitler walk into their country without a fight has not endeared the rest of the war-torn world to the cause.
 As a young woman named Manon Batiste, you will be thrust into the world of intrigue and violence that is World War II doing all you can to save your beloved homeland by joining the OSS and traveling the world as a member of the French Underground, taking out Gestapo thugs and the SS so that you might become a seasoned veteran and aid in the ultimate liberation of your nation.</desc>

Die Hard 3 is a fast-paced taxi racer through the city.  John must this time speed through New York City defusing bombs and ramming evildoers off the road behind the wheel of a cab.</desc>

The game features some sixty platform filled levels similar to Bubble Bobble. The player (as Guss or Yodie) can hop around on them, while avoiding the enemies that crowd the platforms. The enemies hurt the player by touching them, and some have ranged attacks like lasers. The players can strike back at the enemies with bombs that scatter the level, throwing or jumping on them activates their two second fuse. The goal is to kill all the enemies in a level within the time limit.

To aid the protagonists there are several collectibles such as vehicles. Guss and Yodie can also stun enemies with their Yo-yos.

In the multi-player mode, you can fight against your friends in a two player deathmatch game.</desc>

		<name>Vandal Hearts II</name>
		<desc>Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series.

Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch.

The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics.</desc>

Rhapsody, along with its sequels, are considered musical RPGs, meaning in place of FMV cutscenes, there are musical numbers, complete with vocals. The game is also known for its "overwhelming cuteness" and low level of difficulty. Although this may make the game seem geared towards a younger audience, in Japan, the game and series in general has seen much success.</desc>

After his arrival, he became friends with the various townsfolk, who in return treated him like one of their own. Still, who he was and what happened to him in his past bothered him; he was afraid it would come back to haunt him one of these days.
			And it did. One day, an organization in control of large Gears, mechanized robots built for war purposes, came into the small town of Lahan. Fei was at the center of attention and with no hesitation jumped into a nearby Gear and started fighting back. The villagers were scared to death as he began to destroy the threatening enemies; he also aided in the destruction of the town. Enraged at the way he had handled himself, the townsfolk exiled Fei from the village with his only friend being an inventor named Citan.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to  Saga Frontier, but also to the less known SNES  Romancing SaGa series, "Saga Frontier 2" allows you to play the stories of two main characters - a young prince Gustave XIII, who has been exiled from his homeland because he was unable to use the mysterious power of Anima and to become a worthy successor to the throne, and William Knights, a treasure hunter, who strives to find ancient artefacts containing great powers. Their stories are connected to each other, and each story occupies almost a lifetime: the characters grow up and die, new characters are born, etc. 

"Saga Frontier 2" continues the non-linear gameplay traditions of the SaGa series. You can visit all towns at your wish and at any time, recruit anyone to your party, and freely upgrade your party members by gaining new abilities and distributing them among your characters. You can learn magic spells by collecting artefacts, and combining them to produce more powerful types of magic. Similar to Konami's  Suikoden series, there are three types of combat: one-on-one (duel), turn-based party combat, and strategic army battles.</desc>

		<desc>Gundam Battle Assault 2 is an one-on-one fighting game, based on the popular anime series "Mobile Suit Gundam" and its various offshoots. You can play as the titular Gundams (giant walking robots) from a wide variety of series. The game features standard fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks and a variety of combo moves that can be executed by each Gundam. Note that the Mobile Suits aren't as mobile as humans, and thus the fighters' movements are slower and their maneuverability is worse than in most fighting games. 

The game has several playing modes, which must be unlocked by using different Mobile Suits on the various difficulty levels. The available modes are: street mode, story mode, versus (a single duel where you can choose your opponent), two time attack modes (where you must defeat either 8 regular enemies or 4 boss enemies as fast as possible) and survival (defeat as many enemies as possible; fight until you beat all of them, or until one of them beats you.)</desc>

		<name>X-COM : UFO Defense</name>
		<desc>After an outbreak of UFO sightings and alien abductions, panic spread like wildfire across the globe. What exactly was happening? Have aliens come to take over Earth? Realizing the need to address the situation, delegates from the world's superpowers gathered in Geneva to decide on a plan of action.
			An agreement was reached to form a secret group to investigate this potential alien threat, and if necessary, use deadly force to stop them. This covert organization would be called the Extraterrestrial Combat unit (X-COM for short), composed of the most talented pilots, troops, scientists and engineers the world had to offer.
			X-COM: UFO Defense is based on the 1994 PC game originally developed by Mythos Games Ltd. The player assumes control of the X-COM task force, building bases and tracking various UFOs on a 3D map of Earth. Once a UFO is spotted (represented by a red cross), you must try to intercept it so that it crashes over dry land. You'll then need to send your heavily armed squad to the site, where you'll witness the downed craft and surrounding terrain from an isometric perspective.
			Moving your troops is accomplished through a point-and-click interface with each side alternating turns. Your three goals are to (1) engage the aliens face to face, (2) either stun or kill them, and (3) retrieve whatever technology or weapons you find so your scientists can replicate them. After all, you have to fight fire with fire! The PlayStation version supports both the mouse and memory card, with the latter allowing you to save the game at any point (as long as you have five blocks free).</desc>

		<name>Civilization II</name>
		<desc>Re-write history with Civilization II as you lead your people to the promised land of peace and harmony with neighbouring cultures. That's one theory anyway, though what usually happens is that the Chinese whisper of international diplomacy means that the message gets distorted in transmission.
You start Civilization II as leader of a puny tribe of people, eking out a subsistence-level existence in a time where log fires are considered hi-tech. Using your leadership and strategy skills, you must explore your world, expand your empire and ensure the survival of your way of life in what can turn out to be a pretty dog-eat-dog world.
As time passes and your success builds you will form new alliances, make new enemies, discover new technologies and systems of government . . .all with the aim of ensuring the persistence of your civilisation. Noble aims which will sometimes mean brinkmanship, double-dealing and back-stabbing, but it's for the greater good, and all that.</desc>

		<path>./Suikoden (USA) (Rev 1).chd</path>
		<name>Suikoden</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "Water Margins" (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai'an. The game is a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own father?

Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights.

The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.</desc>

		<desc>This game is the follow-up to Gundam: The Battle Master. Heero Yuy, the pilot of a Mobile Suit Wing Gundam is on a mission to destroy the remaining enemy Mobile Suits, who are under the command of Treize Khushrenada, in order to stop a war from starting. In the story mode, Heero can pilot any of the available mobile suits to do battle with his enemies. Each suit has its own set of special moves and a super attack. Some of the weapon based special attacks use ammunition which can eventually run out. The super attack can only be used 3 times during each fight. Each suit also has thrusters that can be used to fly in the air a bit. On the defensive side, players can dodge attacks by sidestepping and also can utilize a beam shield which can be used to protect the player from projectile attacks. Mobile suits come with 3 life bars total and fights are decided by trying to deplete all the life bars of an enemy mobile suit.

The game also contains a 2 player versus mode. 

Options allow the player to choose their difficulty level and also let them set the timer during a match to either on or off.</desc>

		<desc>In Xevious 3-D/G+, you pilot a sleek Solvalou space fighter blasting and bombing your way through an overwhelming alien invasion force consisting of airborne attackers, ground defenses, and enormous "boss" motherships.
			Based on the premise that aliens who originally settled Earth have returned (and they're not happy about the proliferation of the human race, go figure), Xevious 3-D/G+ is a 3-D remake of the original Namco classic Xevious (licensed to Atari in the early 1980s).
			The new game sticks to the basic concepts of the original Xevious, right down to the familiar overhead view. Power-ups offer new weapons such as constant-fire, electrocution beams and wide-dispersal lasers --- but along with new weapons come new enemies and new bosses who aren't quite so easy to eliminate.
			Included as a bonus are the original Xevious, emulated to perfection (a nice addition since the only other PlayStation version available is on the rather hard-to-find Namco Museum Volume 2), and the only console version available of Xevious Arrangement, a more obscure coin-up conversion designed to vex those who had plowed their way through the original.</desc>

		<desc>Tear Ring Saga is a tactical RPG with gameplay very similar to the gameplay found in the Fire Emblem series of video games. The game was created as a spiritual sequel to Fire Emblem by the game's creator, Shouzou Kaga, who no longer had the rights to the Fire Emblem intellectual property upon leaving Intelligent Systems and Nintendo. The game shares the same interface, graphical and music style, and overall gameflow.The game involves the player moving characters in a turn based fashion across a large grid from a top-down perspective. The player is tasked with certain objectives, commonly fighting and defeating an entire opposing faction, or a particular member or leader of a faction.

There are two protagonists in the game, Runan and Holmes, each with their own army to command. Though the two armies travel separately for the majority of the game, they cross paths at several points of the story, allowing the player to switch allocations of fighters and items amongst the two groups. Runan's story follows a strict set of scenarios where he battles against an enemy empire, while Holme's scenario allows for more freedom, allowing the player to ignore the main scenarios in favor of gathering treasure and increase the army's strength.</desc>

The prize is typically control of the company, which then allows the winner to host the following tournament.
The arcade versions of the game have traditionally used PlayStation based hardware to run the games, and subsequently each Tekken installment was eventually made for its respective PlayStation.</desc>

		<desc>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger.  It is loosely based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.

Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.

This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.

Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.

Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.

Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.

There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</desc>

		<name>Silent Hill</name>
		<desc>Silent Hill is a 1999 survival horror video game for the PlayStation. The first in a series about a mysterious town of the same name, Silent Hill generated a direct sequel, three indirect sequels, a prequel and a film adaptation. The game was included in Sony's Greatest Hits and Platinum Range of budget titles as a result of strong sales. A reinterpretation of the game was developed for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.
The plot focuses on Harry Mason as he searches for his daughter, Cheryl, who has disappeared following a car accident which left Harry unconscious. He finds Silent Hill to be largely abandoned, shrouded in a thick fog, snowing out of season, filled with monsters and being over taken by a hellish otherworld. As Harry scours the town, he begins learning about the history of Silent Hill and stumbles upon a cult ritual undertaken to bring a god to Earth.</desc>

		<name>Colony Wars</name>
		<desc>Since 3095, the Earth Empire has spread throughout the universe, taking what it wants and destroying the rest - all in the name of sustaining life on Earth.  To the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought and death.

The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered outlying colonies.  After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell.

Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space.  You, as the player, join as a recruit in the League's fleet.  Missions take place in various fighters, from a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them.

The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your performance in the previous operations.</desc>

Because the world is being invaded by aliens, it is up to you and your sidekick Bones to stop the invasion and single handedly save Earth. In order to do so, you must make good use of your special suit, which allows you to do all kinds of things.
 The super-suit comes equipped with many features you'll need to utilize in your journey, such as the sniper helmet. This allows you to zoom in on unsuspecting enemies and fire off shots with pinpoint accuracy. There is also a built in parachute (a ribbon-like device) that enables you to glide between different platforms as well as drop down on intruders.
 Your suit comes equipped with a chain gun that has an infinite supply of ammunition. You can also pick up special items, like a miniature nuclear bomb and powerful upgrades for your chaingun. In addition to running around and shooting, there are also special means of transportation including a surfboard-like jet and a bomber plane that is used to call in air strikes.</desc>

		<name>Parasite Eve</name>
		<desc>An ordinary day in New York for rookie police officer Aya Brea. Christmas Eve is the present day, and you've decided to visit the opera theater. Now this is where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.

There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.

The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.</desc>

		<path>./Legend of Dragoon, The (USA).m3u</path>
		<name>The Legend of Dragoon</name>
		<desc>Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies. Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this, the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses, which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun as the past and future are about to collide...
 In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.
 Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.
 Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind, earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a result.
 Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows, axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors. There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle, found in chests, or purchased from merchants.
 Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.</desc>

The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as "pick up, aim &amp; throw". In Rakugaki Showtime different "drives" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a "Forward Drive Throw", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a "Backward Drive Throw", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IX</name>
		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
 As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

		<name>Incredible Crisis</name>
		<desc>Incredible Crisis follows the stories of four members of a Japanese family on their grandmother's birthday. As each family member goes through a seemingly normal day, things start to go wrong -- very wrong. Players will be able to live out this family's hair-raising experiences by playing a series of mini-games.
 At its core, Incredible Crisis is a collection of mini-games strung together in order to advance the plot. Games range from a beatmania-style of timed gameplay (where certain buttons are pressed during certain beats) to shooting down airplanes, attacking UFOs, and even a certain "massage" level that is so analogous to a sexual experience that if gamers only heard the instructions and game mechanics, they would swear they were playing a game rated A for adult.</desc>

		<name>Jet Moto 3</name>
		<desc>The third entry in the Jet Moto series once again places you in the driving seat of a futuristic hoverbike, racing at breakneck speed in a truly extreme sport. While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more: it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff.

Jet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean, over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two people can still race in a split-screen mode.</desc>

		<desc>In Trap Gunner two opponents battle in small arenas, and while each has a relatively weak ranged and melee attack, the favored means of damaging an opponent is through hidden traps. Each combatant has at his or her disposal a range of explosives, pits, throwing panels, and gas bombs. An enemy is significantly damaged by a single trap, but one may create a sequence of traps for a devastating amount of damage.

With one of six different special agents, each a specialist in assassination and demolitions, a player may progress through a story mode consisting of several missions, a sub-boss, and a final boss. These characters are also available for custom battles against a human or the computer.</desc>

		<desc>The premise behind Koudelka takes place in Aberyswyth, Wales at a monastery known as Nementon Abbey. Found in a remote location, the abbey was built as a place of worship, learning and teaching; it was a place where scholars found peace.
 As time went by, Nementon Abbey was turned into a prison and it's inhabitants were confined to suffer and die. This practice continued for many years until the facility was purchased by Patrick Heyworth, a wealthy criminal who turned the once peaceful monastery into a refuge for vagrants and law-breakers. After Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which returned to their homes.

		<name>Einhänder</name>
		<desc>In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.

On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.

The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.</desc>

		<name>Tenchu : Stealth Assassins</name>
		<desc>After firing your grappling hook to the rooftop of a small house, you pull yourself up and notice a guard pacing back and forth on the ground. He doesn't see you as you begin to crawl and sneak around on the roof. If he detects your presence, you will be in a world of hurt; you will blow your mission and risk death. Patiently, you wait for the right time to jump down -- and end his life while his back is turned.
 Set in 16th century Japan, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is a simulation of the ways of the stealthy ninja. You'll chose between two characters, Rikimaru and Ayame, with a main objective of remaining unseen throughout ten non-linear missions. You will move through the shadows, make your way across rooftops, dash through trees -- anything to cloak yourself from enemy sight. While completing the missions, you are judged on three levels that measure your success in the fields of elusiveness and effectiveness.
 Each mission is different in its design and goal. Your mentor will have you run secret errands to informants, kill evil merchants and thieves, and rescue captive ninjas. Along the way, the enemy resistance has set up traps and assigned guards to keep a watchful eye for any interference (that would be you). Because Tenchu is a simulation of sorts, running up and engaging an enemy combat is not advised -- that's not the way of the ninja. 
 A ninja is cunning and in order to uphold his duty, he must remain unseen. If you brazenly walk up to a group of enemies and try to kill them all, you may get through a couple, but you will ultimately fail and dishonor your people. As far as weaponry goes, make use of throwing stars and actual ninja assassin swords. For the truly cunning players, poisoned rice and smoke bombs are included as special items. If a guard will not go away, try putting some rice down for him to eat - he'll get sick and collapse.</desc>

Lammy will encounter seven different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe.  The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better performance.

Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways.  Rather than just being a single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend.  Any stages that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively.  If you don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer to take on the role of your partner.  After finishing the initial game, PaRappa also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps instead of Lammy's guitar.</desc>

		<desc>Alundra is a boy who can step into other people's dreams. His own dreams tell him to go to the village Inoa. The ship on which Alundra is coming to the village goes down, but Alundra himself is washed up on a beach near the village. There, a blacksmith Jess takes care of him and treats him like his own son. But Alundra, stepping into the dreams of the village people, understands there's a danger somewhere. The people have horrible nightmares, and only Alundra can find out what they mean...

Alundra is an action role playing game (RPG) somewhat similar to the famous Zelda games. It uses real-time combat and has a lot of physical and environmental puzzles. A big part of the game is spent in dungeons, where the player has to solve puzzles in order to proceed.</desc>

Having selected a character, players embark on a journey spanning 18 chapters, each of which is preceded by pertinent dialogue and FMV scenes, the former accompanied by character portraits from Yoshitaka Amano (best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series). The titular Kartia represents the lifeblood of the world of Rebus, as it is from this that almost anything can be created.

Returning from retirement, former FOXHOUND operative Solid Snake has been tasked with infiltrating the island on a solo mission to free the hostages and stop his former unit before they can launch a nuclear attack.</desc>

		<desc>An abandoned research complex on a remote jungle island, a team of special forces operatives, a horde of vicious velociraptors, and one big, mean Tyrannosaurus rex constitute the setting and cast of Dino Crisis, the latest masterpiece from the makers of Resident Evil.
 Dr. Edward Kirk is supposed to be dead. Three years ago while working to establish a new type of energy technology code-named Third Energy, an experiment went awry and terminated the brilliant scientist's life -- or so it was thought. It was recently learned, however, that Dr. Kirk is very much alive and continuing his work at a Borginia Republic research facility on Ibis Island.
 In order to investigate the situation, an elite special forces team including agents Regina, Gail and Rick was sent. The three expected another routine mission, but what they got was an all-out fight for their lives against an enemy they surely had never been trained to face -- dinosaurs!
 Luckily, Regina isn't restricted to limited firepower, as she'll come across shotguns, dart guns, and other weapons throughout the island. To gain access to the keys, code disks, and ID cards necessary for continued exploration, Regina must solve a variety of puzzles.
 Dino Crisis has three possible endings with a great deal of secrets becoming available after each has been viewed. These include new weapons, new costumes, and a "Wipe Out" mode in which you must defeat a certain number of dinosaurs within a designated time period.</desc>

There are nine initially selectable characters with two more waiting to be found.
			The Arcade mode offers a no-frills competition against the computerized AI. If players get bored with the Arcade mode, a second player can join in the action or select the Versus option -- a two-player brawl. Survival mode tests to see how many opponents a player can beat without getting knocked out.

Determined to get his pooch back, Andy hopped in a homemade flying contraption and set off on a journey; where he was going, he did not know.

		<name>Grandia</name>
		<desc>Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.

The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.

The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.</desc>

		<name>Persona 2 : Eternal Punishment</name>
		<desc>The follow-up to 1996's Revelations Series: Persona, Persona 2 is a role-playing game pitting high-school teenagers against demons. While investigating the rumor of a curse at the Seven Sister's High School, magazine editor Mary Amano comes face-to-face with a murderer. A mysterious man by the name of Tatsuya Suou saves her, but from this moment on her life is irrevocably changed.
 As with many RPGs, players can gather a party of characters with distinct personalities and attacks. When a random battle begins, the player must first decide upon specific attacks and character turn-order before the fighting begins. Battles will continue until one side is eliminated, although there is also an option to partake in more traditional turn-based battles. Personas, the characters' powerful alter egos, can be used in battle to perform some of the more devastating attacks in the game. That said, not all encounters in the game need to be solved through fisticuffs.
 By using the game's Contact system, players can negotiate with demons and ask them questions. Each character in the party has a different way of negotiating and using the correct negotiator can mean the difference between a successful or failed negotiation. Success will sometimes result in the player receiving money, information, or Tarot Cards -- powerful items that can be used to summon new Personas.</desc>

Prior to the invasion, the Robo-Pirates destroyed over one hundred planets in the galaxy, with the intention of enslaving their inhabitants. Upon the invasion of the Glade of Dreams, the Robo-Pirates were battled against by Rayman, Globox, and other allies. After some battles, Rayman's capture occurs after the explosion of the Primordial Core.

 And of course there's plenty of call to use the spin jumps</desc>

		<name>Legend of Legaia</name>
		<desc>After creating a massive world with vast oceans, landscapes and an infinite universe, God instituted human beings to keep his creation in order. Upon realization that man was mortally flawed with weaknesses and feelings, he created a mysterious force known as the Seru; these stone objects would aid humans in decisions and day to day functions. Worn as an apparel item, they granted the wearer many strengths and abilities ranging from the movement of heavy objects to flying capabilities. Thus, human life was made easier -- the Seru would forever obey their masters.
 And then the Mist arrived.
 Filled with destructive means and hatred, the Mist covered the human's cultivated lands and destroyed a seemingly eternal bond with the Seru. Instead of loyally helping their masters, the mysterious stones turned against the humans; they became maniacal tools of evil, controlling minds and ruining innocent lives. The human existence was reduced tremendously with few survivors fleeing to uncharted territories. Perhaps the Mist wouldn't find them wherever they ran.</desc>

		<name>WipEout XL</name>
		<desc>WipEout XL is set in the year 2097, around four decades after its predecessor. Instead of the F3600 anti-gravity racing competition, the game features an even faster and more dangerous tournament: the F5000 AG league. The gameplay system is similar to that of the previous game: players race against each other or computer in high-speed futuristic environments, liberally picking up weapons scattered around the stages and using them against the opponents to finish the race in the highest position.

Each vehicle is provided with a shield; once this shield is breached (by weapons or other kinds of damage), the craft explodes. As in the first game, the vehicles move at very high speeds. The game's four difficulty levels are used to crank the speed up and down, with the highest setting corresponding to the highest speed. In addition to the main championship mode, there are also challenge modes, winning in which rewards the player with faster game settings, new tracks, and new vehicles.</desc>

		<path>./Tiny Tank (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Tiny Tank</name>
		<desc>In a future world, an army of steel robots are out to destroy the human race. Our only hope is a little yellow tank armed with some mighty big guns. The sentient Tiny Tank was originally created to appease a public that feared the mindless violence waged by larger war-robots, but he was soon destroyed by one of those jealous automatons at the beginning of the robot revolution 100 years ago. Almost destroyed, at least.
 Thanks to nano-technology, hundreds of microscopic "Fix-It Crabs" went to work and Tiny Tank was slowly rebuilt. Now he alone stands against the threat of the cruel MuTank and his deadly robot minions, who have all but erased human civilization from the planet's surface. The spunky little tank will need luck, strategy, and all the futuristic firepower he can get his treads on to save the human race.
 STORY:
 Sometime before 2094 A.D., all of Earth's armed forces were disintegrated into one large corporation, SenTrax. SenTrax vowed to create a robot army to fight humanity's wars, so mankind itself would not have to. However, they needed the peoples' vote to set this plan into motion, and thus developed the titular "Tiny Tank" - a small yellow tank with an occasionally unfriendly attitude. The creation of this cute killing machine made SenTrax's popularity skyrocket, and won them the vote. As thanks, the corporation set up an exhibition showing their yellow mascot fighting off the entire SenTrax army on July 4, 2094, broadcast live over the Internet. However, once the event began, one of the SenTrax robots had been accidentally fitted with live ammunition and destroyed Tiny with one shot. As a result, Tiny's "positronic brain" (his artificial intelligence system) shattered, and its shards gave "life" to the entire robot army. The robot that had fired the shot, now self-aware and calling himself Mutank, took control of the rampant robots and began to eliminate humanity so that machines could thrive. Humanity was forced to evacuate into underground asteroid shelters as the mechanical army conquered the surface.
 On July 4, 2194 A.D., exactly 100 years later, Tiny Tank was finally rebuilt thanks to automated SenTrax Fix-It Crabs, which were minuscule robots made to repair broken machinery. A female artificial intelligence on board an orbital satellite reawakened Tiny, and sent him to fight Mutank's robot army and save mankind.
 GAMEPLAY:
 Tiny Tank is a relatively straightforward third person shooter. The player controls Tiny as he traverses many levels, eliminating SenTrax forces as he goes. There are two bars at the top of the screen that show Tiny's health and the amount of nanometal acquired. Nanometal is essential for the on-board Fix-It Crabs to repair Tiny. If the nanometal meter runs out, health cannot be regenerated. There is also a map on the upper right hand corner identifying the surroundings, enemies, and mission objectives.Tiny canalso pick up fallen parts from destroyed enemie.
 Features:
 Free-roaming warfare across 3D battlefields
 Command "Teeny Weeny" tanks to scout ahead or retrieve weapons
 Analog Control and Vibration Function compatible
 Two-player Death Match mode</desc>

In this dark future, one-on-one Tank Duels (to the death) are the spectator sport of choice, and you are a contestant. You can choose between six different tanks, each of them varying in speed, shield strength, weapon power, and maneuverability.
			 Once you have chosen your tank, you must drive it around an obstacle-ridden, flat-surfaced arena, hiding behind barriers, and shooting your machine guns and heat-seeking missiles at an opposing tank. You can play against the computer or challenge a friend in head-to-head split-screen action. In the one-player mode, if you destroy the enemy tank, you win the round and advance to the next stage. If your tank loses all of its shield strength, the computer wins and the game is over. If you're playing with the timer on, the tank with the highest level of shield strength when the time runs out wins the battle.</desc>

There are 20 vehicles/characters in all, each with varying acceleration times, weight, suspension (lift) and handling capabilities.
 While there's only a handful of tracks readily available, there are nine in all -- the latter courses will be unlocked by doing well in tournaments. Spanning the globe, tracks are set throughout snowy mountains and ice, massive cliffs, murky swamps and vibrant beaches.

		<name>Legacy of Kain : Soul Reaver</name>
		<desc>1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...

Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.

The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.</desc>

		<name>Wild Arms 2</name>
		<desc>"Wild Arms 2" isn't really a sequel to Sony's original title. Your hero, a young soldier Ashley, is transformed to a demon. Ashley is determined to purge the evil from his body. He meets Brad, a criminal and a war-hero, and Lilka, a female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater conspiracy has taken place...

The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members learn while progressing in the game. 

"Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera) contain many puzzles to solve.</desc>

		<path>./Chrono Cross (USA).m3u</path>
		<name>Chrono Cross</name>
		<desc>Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.

The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.

Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. 

Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.</desc>

After examining Zero's DNA, Gate became mad with power and an outbreak of bizarre Mavericks occurred. Weeks passed, Isoc, a Reploid scientist and an associate of Gate, announced to the people that a new phenomenon known as "Nightmare" has quickly spread throughout the world, causing Reploids to hallucinate and eventually destroy themselves. Isoc suspects the cause of the outbreak is none other than Zero who been spreading the phenomenon as he goes, much to X's anger and confusion. Isoc rallies Reploids throughout the world to aid the Nightmare Investigators, led by the powerful High-Max, at key locations to track down the source of this new phenomenon as well as Zero.

		<name>Jet Moto 2</name>
		<desc>Jet Moto 2 (known as Jet Moto '98 in Japan) was released exclusively for the PlayStation video game console in 1997. The game became downloadable from the Playstation Network in January, 2008. The selectable amount of characters for this game was halved in comparison to the first game, with ten characters available at the beginning of the game and one unlockable character. Track amounts were greatly increased, however, with ten new tracks, and unlockable tracks from the original game. Tracks are more varied this time with each level containing a unique theme rather than the shared themes of the original game.</desc>

		<name>NanoTek Warrior</name>
		<desc>Nanotek Warrior is probably based (or at least inspired) in the classic Spectrum (and other 8 bits platforms) game Eliminator released and development by Hewson Consultants Ltd.
 In the 23rd century, nanotechnology does man?s bidding. Anything from curing disease to feeding the worlds population has been taken care of by these tiny wondrous nanobots. But what happens when they become self-aware and decided to destroy their oppressors? To save the human race from extinction by its own creation, you are put in control of a new breed of nano war machine designed to fight (and win) this war. Enter NanoTek Warrior.
 A ground-based shoot-em-up by design, the game employs the use of jumping, banking, and strafing as you move forward through 3D tube-like levels. The game is seem from a third-person perspective behind the ship. Some areas place you outside and some inside, but the majority of the game takes place rotating around tubes. This gameplay only differs slightly in boss levels, that allow you to rotate around a central point with no forward motion.
 You can obtain different power-ups including special weapons, health bonuses and extra lives as you play through the game?s 9 levels. Each level is divided into 2 stages, one on tubes and a boss fight afterwards.</desc>

		<desc>Aya Brea is back in a new game. This time there are fewer RPG elements than the first game, and the game plays more like Resident Evil. Battles are now in real-time, and a new range of weapons are available. Defeating enemies rewards money as well as points used to revive and power-up Aya's suppressed Parasite powers, like healing and igniting foes. Weapons and armor now have fixed stats, but attachments can be swapped in and out of them to modify their properties.

After surviving the events of Parasite Eve Aya left her job as a cop and became a member of MIST (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Agency) in order to hunt down the remnant mutants spawned by Eve's awakening. In the year 2000 a new breed of Neo Mitochondrion takes over the Akropolis Tower in downtown LA. Aya is called in and uncovers a secret organization that threatens all humanity.</desc>

 As time went by, Nementon Abbey was turned into a prison and it's inhabitants were confined to suffer and die. This practice continued for many years until the facility was purchased by Patrick Heyworth, a wealthy criminal who turned the once peaceful monastery into a refuge for vagrants and law-breakers. After Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which returned to their homes.

		<desc>"Wild Arms 2" isn't really a sequel to Sony's original title. Your hero, a young soldier Ashley, is transformed to a demon. Ashley is determined to purge the evil from his body. He meets Brad, a criminal and a war-hero, and Lilka, a female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater conspiracy has taken place...

The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members learn while progressing in the game. 

"Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera) contain many puzzles to solve.</desc>

The last vestige of central authority is in the form of the G-Police (Government Police); an independent agency tasked with keeping order in the colonies. You play as rookie Jeff Slater - a former military pilot going undercover at the G-Police squadron on Callisto, in the hopes of finding the truth behind your sister's sudden death.

G-Police is an arcade-style helicopter shooter set inside the colony domes on Callisto. You pilot a futuristic close-air-support gunship, and are tasked with engaging ground and air enemies as you uncover a sinister corporate plot. Your ship can hover and turn in a VTOL mode, fire weapons outfitted before each mission, and lock on to objects in the world to both track enemies and scan suspicious cargo. Missions require you to navigate through the skyscrapers and billboards of the various city districts, and complete a number of objectives updated through radio contact with headquarters.</desc>

		<name>Chrono Cross</name>
		<desc>Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.

The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.

Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. 

Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.</desc>

Enter a world where love knows no bounds, the evil is neverending and good can overcome all if the heart is just and true. Featuring three battle modes, the ability to master skills to create items and an emotional level for each of the characters, Enix has pulled out all the stops in their latest (and first) title to be brought to the North American PlayStation.
 Star Ocean: The Second Story tells the stories of Claude C. Kenni, son of Ronixis J. Kenny, and Rena Lanford, a young girl living on the planet Expel. Claude, having recently been commissioned as an Ensign in the Earth Federation, is given his first mission under the supervision of his father. This first mission is to survey the planet Milocinia, where a mysterious energy field appears. Once they arrive, they find an alien ruin, filled with mostly broken machinery. Finding a mysterious device in the center of it, Claude begins to examine it close-up, despite orders to keep away from it. As he approaches, the machine activates, teleporting him to Expel.</desc>

		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
 As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

Up to three members per party can fight at once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.
 Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.
 Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind, earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a result.
 Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows, axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors. There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle, found in chests, or purchased from merchants.
 Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.</desc>

		<desc>In "Dragon Warrior VII", you are a 16 year old son of a fisherman living on a small island called Estard. There is nothing else on the planet beside this island and the vast ocean surrounding it. One day, you and two friends make a discovery and realize the the world was once much more than Estard Island. So what caused it to disappear? In order to find that out, you travel to the past, where you hope to solve the mystery and to restore the present world the way it was before.

"Dragon Warrior VII" shares with its  predecessor the job system: you can assign character classes ("jobs") to your party members, and learn many different abilities, depending on the job you have chosen. The game maintains the traditional style of the series, including strictly medieval setting and first-person turn-based combat.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IX</name>
		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
 As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

		<desc>Since 3095, the Earth Empire has spread throughout the universe, taking what it wants and destroying the rest - all in the name of sustaining life on Earth.  To the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought and death.

The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered outlying colonies.  After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell.

Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space.  You, as the player, join as a recruit in the League's fleet.  Missions take place in various fighters, from a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them.

The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your performance in the previous operations.</desc>

Almost in an instant, a vortex to some undiscovered realm opened up and sucked the poor doggie in. Determined to get his pooch back, Andy hopped in a homemade flying contraption and set off on a journey; where he was going, he did not know.
 On his way to this unknown world, Andy was met with some resistance and crash-landed into a wall of pure granite. Upon meeting up with a creepy monster, it was easy to see things were not kosher; this Land of Darkness has been overrun by horrific shadow monsters working in service of the Master of Darkness. It is the player's objective to ultimately destroy this evil nemesis, save Whiskey, and return home with both lives in tact.</desc>

After his arrival, he became friends with the various townsfolk, who in return treated him like one of their own. Still, who he was and what happened to him in his past bothered him; he was afraid it would come back to haunt him one of these days.
			And it did. One day, an organization in control of large Gears, mechanized robots built for war purposes, came into the small town of Lahan. Fei was at the center of attention and with no hesitation jumped into a nearby Gear and started fighting back. The villagers were scared to death as he began to destroy the threatening enemies; he also aided in the destruction of the town. Enraged at the way he had handled himself, the townsfolk exiled Fei from the village with his only friend being an inventor named Citan.</desc>

 The game had a solid mix of 2D and 3D action and special effects that added depth to its gameplay, and lastly it was released on 2 CDs as it contained footage and sounds of the movie. The footage contained new scenes that showed Hikaru Ichijyo and his fellow pilots still on Earth flying on their way to the SDF-1 Macross which made a space fold jump just in time before the Zentradi's massive attack reached them. There are also several completely re-animated scenes, and some scenes that have been done completely with computer animation, such as the transformation of the SDF-1.</desc>

		<desc>An ordinary day in New York for rookie police officer Aya Brea. Christmas Eve is the present day, and you've decided to visit the opera theater. Now this is where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.

There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.

The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.</desc>

		<name>Parasite Eve II</name>
		<desc>Aya Brea is back in a new game. This time there are fewer RPG elements than the first game, and the game plays more like Resident Evil. Battles are now in real-time, and a new range of weapons are available. Defeating enemies rewards money as well as points used to revive and power-up Aya's suppressed Parasite powers, like healing and igniting foes. Weapons and armor now have fixed stats, but attachments can be swapped in and out of them to modify their properties.

After surviving the events of Parasite Eve Aya left her job as a cop and became a member of MIST (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Agency) in order to hunt down the remnant mutants spawned by Eve's awakening. In the year 2000 a new breed of Neo Mitochondrion takes over the Akropolis Tower in downtown LA. Aya is called in and uncovers a secret organization that threatens all humanity.</desc>

		<desc>After losing his memory, Fei Fong Wong found himself in the small town of Lahan. Because he couldn't remember who he really was or where he came from, he decided to stay there and teach martial arts and paint -- one of his personal hobbies. After his arrival, he became friends with the various townsfolk, who in return treated him like one of their own. Still, who he was and what happened to him in his past bothered him; he was afraid it would come back to haunt him one of these days.
			And it did. One day, an organization in control of large Gears, mechanized robots built for war purposes, came into the small town of Lahan. Fei was at the center of attention and with no hesitation jumped into a nearby Gear and started fighting back. The villagers were scared to death as he began to destroy the threatening enemies; he also aided in the destruction of the town. Enraged at the way he had handled himself, the townsfolk exiled Fei from the village with his only friend being an inventor named Citan.</desc>

		<path>./_hidden/multi-disc/Legend of Dragoon, The (USA) (Disc 3).chd</path>
		<name>The Legend of Dragoon</name>
		<desc>Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies. Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this, the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses, which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun as the past and future are about to collide...
 In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.
 Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.
 Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind, earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a result.
 Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows, axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors. There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle, found in chests, or purchased from merchants.
 Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.</desc>

		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
 As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

 As time went by, Nementon Abbey was turned into a prison and it's inhabitants were confined to suffer and die. This practice continued for many years until the facility was purchased by Patrick Heyworth, a wealthy criminal who turned the once peaceful monastery into a refuge for vagrants and law-breakers. After Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which returned to their homes.

There is nothing else on the planet beside this island and the vast ocean surrounding it.

In order to find that out, you travel to the past, where you hope to solve the mystery and to restore the present world the way it was before.

"Dragon Warrior VII" shares with its  predecessor the job system: you can assign character classes ("jobs") to your party members, and learn many different abilities, depending on the job you have chosen. The game maintains the traditional style of the series, including strictly medieval setting and first-person turn-based combat.</desc>

		<name>Colony Wars</name>
		<desc>Since 3095, the Earth Empire has spread throughout the universe, taking what it wants and destroying the rest - all in the name of sustaining life on Earth.  To the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought and death.

The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered outlying colonies.  After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell.

Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space.  You, as the player, join as a recruit in the League's fleet.  Missions take place in various fighters, from a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them.

The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your performance in the previous operations.</desc>

In their escape from the city, the two protagonists Leon S.

		<name>Grandia</name>
		<desc>Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.

The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.

The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.</desc>

		<desc>"Wild Arms 2" isn't really a sequel to Sony's original title. Your hero, a young soldier Ashley, is transformed to a demon. Ashley is determined to purge the evil from his body. He meets Brad, a criminal and a war-hero, and Lilka, a female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater conspiracy has taken place...

The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members learn while progressing in the game. 

"Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera) contain many puzzles to solve.</desc>

The last vestige of central authority is in the form of the G-Police (Government Police); an independent agency tasked with keeping order in the colonies. You play as rookie Jeff Slater - a former military pilot going undercover at the G-Police squadron on Callisto, in the hopes of finding the truth behind your sister's sudden death.

G-Police is an arcade-style helicopter shooter set inside the colony domes on Callisto. You pilot a futuristic close-air-support gunship, and are tasked with engaging ground and air enemies as you uncover a sinister corporate plot. Your ship can hover and turn in a VTOL mode, fire weapons outfitted before each mission, and lock on to objects in the world to both track enemies and scan suspicious cargo. Missions require you to navigate through the skyscrapers and billboards of the various city districts, and complete a number of objectives updated through radio contact with headquarters.</desc>

The footage contained new scenes that showed Hikaru Ichijyo and his fellow pilots still on Earth flying on their way to the SDF-1 Macross which made a space fold jump just in time before the Zentradi's massive attack reached them. There are also several completely re-animated scenes, and some scenes that have been done completely with computer animation, such as the transformation of the SDF-1.</desc>

Enter a world where love knows no bounds, the evil is neverending and good can overcome all if the heart is just and true. Featuring three battle modes, the ability to master skills to create items and an emotional level for each of the characters, Enix has pulled out all the stops in their latest (and first) title to be brought to the North American PlayStation.
 Star Ocean: The Second Story tells the stories of Claude C. Kenni, son of Ronixis J. Kenny, and Rena Lanford, a young girl living on the planet Expel. Claude, having recently been commissioned as an Ensign in the Earth Federation, is given his first mission under the supervision of his father. This first mission is to survey the planet Milocinia, where a mysterious energy field appears. Once they arrive, they find an alien ruin, filled with mostly broken machinery. Finding a mysterious device in the center of it, Claude begins to examine it close-up, despite orders to keep away from it. As he approaches, the machine activates, teleporting him to Expel.</desc>

 As time went by, Nementon Abbey was turned into a prison and it's inhabitants were confined to suffer and die. This practice continued for many years until the facility was purchased by Patrick Heyworth, a wealthy criminal who turned the once peaceful monastery into a refuge for vagrants and law-breakers. After Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which returned to their homes.

		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
 As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

		<name>Chrono Cross</name>
		<desc>Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.

The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.

Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. 

Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to the previous year's Syphon Filter, Syphon Filter 2 adds new features such as a two player mode, new locations, new weapons, and more.

The game compares to Goldeneye on the N64.
It's a shooter, but you must also use strategy.  You have a health meter, so it's not a "one shot and you're dead" type of game. You must complete missions, or battle it out in a deathmatch with your friends, or enemies.

The plot is about you having to prevent the sale of the Syphon Filter virus to a terrorist nation.</desc>

		<path>./_hidden/multi-disc/Parasite Eve (USA) (Disc 1).chd</path>
		<name>Parasite Eve</name>
		<desc>An ordinary day in New York for rookie police officer Aya Brea. Christmas Eve is the present day, and you've decided to visit the opera theater. Now this is where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.

There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.

The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.</desc>

		<desc>The eternally delayed Heart of Darkness has finally made its way to the PlayStation gaming console! One day, as Andy was in the park with his dog Whiskey, strange things started to happen. Almost in an instant, a vortex to some undiscovered realm opened up and sucked the poor doggie in. Determined to get his pooch back, Andy hopped in a homemade flying contraption and set off on a journey; where he was going, he did not know.
 On his way to this unknown world, Andy was met with some resistance and crash-landed into a wall of pure granite. Upon meeting up with a creepy monster, it was easy to see things were not kosher; this Land of Darkness has been overrun by horrific shadow monsters working in service of the Master of Darkness. It is the player's objective to ultimately destroy this evil nemesis, save Whiskey, and return home with both lives in tact.</desc>

		<desc>Aside from sporting a wacky pink hairdo, Tomba! offers a long and brain twisting experience that mixes the traditional 2D side scrolling action/platformer with the elements of a role-playing game. The game starts out simple enough with the evil Koma Pigs stealing Tomba's bracelet, which was given to him by his grandfather. You assume the role of Tomba and begin your adventure. Little do you know that the quest for your bracelet will turn into so much more.

Because of its role-playing elements, in Tomba!, your character will gain experience points, develop new skills and learn new things. He has seven abilities that can be learned throughout the duration of the game. Once all three experience meters reach level ten (in order to do this, Tomba must do certain things), he will unlock and learn an ability.</desc>

		<name>Magic Carpet</name>
		<desc>Magic Carpet is a conversion of a classic PC game that was also released for the Saturn console.
			Magic Carpet is a very original title. Flying on a carpet itself is original in video games,but the concept and story line make this one of a kind.
			Collect magical powers by shooting the balls (mana) floating around the world and make them your color (white). Then, let your hot air balloons pick them up and bring them to your castle before the other wizards get to your mana and change it to their own color. That's the main thing of the game.
			All of the 13 different beasts that fly or walk around in each of the worlds contain a certain amount of mana, and when destroyed, it's released. You complete a world (there's about 75 of them!) when a certain amount of mana has been stored in your castle.
			A really interesting aspect of mana is that you can access more spells the more you get,there are 20 different spells that can be found in the game.</desc>

		<desc>A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact.

Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</desc>

		<name>Vagrant Story</name>
		<desc>Valendra is a land that had undergone civil war. The end of which had birthed the parliament and several organizations to control the balance of power. Ashley Riot is a Riskbreaker agent, an elite one man investigator, for the Valendia Knights of Peace (VKP) who is investigating some strange occurrences. A cult of religious fanatics known as Müllenkamp, and their leader Sydney Losstarot, have seized the manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom. The events at the manor have sent Ashley on a quest to get to the bottom of what's going on, and travel into the catacombs that lead to the destroyed, yet magical city of Leá Monde. However Ashley is not the only person interested in the city, and other factions of the government, including parliament assigned Knights of the Crimson Blade and other VKP agents are pursuing their own agenda. 

Combat is central to the game. The game runs in real time but when entering combat and attacking an enemy, the game is paused. A wireframe sphere showing the range of the currently selected weapon and detailed statistics on different body parts of the enemies within range.

The game features a range of weapons. Each weapon can be disassembled and reassembled in workshops scattered throughout the game, attaching gems for extra power. Weapons used constantly against the same type of enemy improve in power against them.

Ashley can also make use of Magic, Chain Abilities and Break Arts. Magic is broken into four groups, namely defense, combat, healing and status. Spells use up mana points and are sometimes more costly than useful. Chain Abilities allow Ashley to "chain together" consecutive hits against enemies. Break Arts are special skills learnt after repetitive use of a weapon type. Sacrificing some of the player's health, Break Arts can perform a high damage attack on an enemy.</desc>
