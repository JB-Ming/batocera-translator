		<name>Jurassic Park</name>
		<desc>This game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</desc>

The queen Velvet sent the cute little fairy Silk to seek aid by the red-haired witch Cotton, the only one who could defeat Wool. Cotton agrees under one condition: she will receive some willows as a reward, since willows are her favorite food. Finally, after defeating Wool, Cotton realized that someone poisoned the promised willows, and swears revenge. Accompanied by Silk, she begins to chase the mysterious enemy.

This is where the player takes control of the games protagonist and pilots the suit in an attempt to reclaim the Earth.

The gameplay is a hack-n-slash game, where the player controls the suit by using the D-pad and using the face buttons to slash at enemy monsters.  There is also a Super Attack that the player can use, but it will decrease their health after each use.  The enemies consist of mutant animals such as dogs and beetles as well as the Bio-Beast soldiers that can range from regular soldiers, female fighters and even ninjas.

There are five levels in all (Tokyo, Asia, Europe, New York and Egypt) divided into three stages with a mini-boss and a main boss the player must defeat to advance to the next level.

One day in Antarctica, an asteroid crashes into the crystal that protects the penguins, shattering it into many pieces and freeing the Sno-Bees who had been frozen in ice. In order to rescue his people, the blue penguin (along with a pink penguin in two-player mode) goes after the Sno-Bees and to recover the missing pieces of the crystal. The game takes the basic template of the 1982 original and expands on it, offering a greater variety of enemies, various environmental hazards, and power-ups, along with of course updated 16-bit graphics and sound. The goal is still to push blocks and crush enemies. Enemies now appear from generators, which must be destroyed to stop new enemies from appearing, and all enemies must then be eliminated to complete each stage.

		<desc>Badh the queen has imposed a terrible vengeance on the land by kidnapping the fairies. To restore things their rightful way, you must rescue them.

As you progress through the levels of platform-adventure action, you will come across fairies which are rescued by touching them. Enemies include Venus Fly Traps, localized acid rain showers and dragons, which can be avoided or shot in the bonus shoot 'em up sections. You will need help to reach some levels; this comes from Mael Dvin the Eagle. After each level there's a bonus game in which tears must be collected for points.</desc>

		<name>Growl</name>
		<desc>In the early part of the 20th century, a group of evil poachers recklessly hunted animals to the point of extinction, including lions, deers, elephants, eagles, and several others.

Growl is a one-player game, in which you control one of four characters (Gen, Burn, Khan, and Jack) and you must defeat these evil poachers by dealing with them with your fists. However, there are weapons that can be found, including grenades, rocket launchers, whips, swords, guns, and shotguns, which you get once an enemy drops them on the ground, so you can use these weapons against them. If you manage to get one of the guns, you can shoot enemies with a limited supply of ammo. Once the ammo runs out, your only option is to pistol-whip them.

Also, you can pick up crates and barrels and haul it at enemies to knock them down. Along the way, you'll encounter several cases of animal cruelty, such as two men whipping a lion. Stop the animal cruelty, and the animals will help you in your quest to defeat these evil poachers.</desc>

		<path>./Road Rash 3 (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Road Rash 3</name>
		<desc>Following the previous two Road Rash games, the player has conquered the US illegal motorcycle championship. But why settle for that when one can take over the World; racing in the peaceful streets of the UK, dodging the animals in Kenya, blaze through the night in Japan or jump in the hilly circuits in Italy?

Keeping the same spirit of the previous two games, Road Rash 3 adds all new digitized sprites (based on the 32-bit remake released an year earlier), bike upgrades, more weapons and meaner police. Most other aspects of the game remain unchanged: the player starts on the lowest division with a small amount of cash and a slow, hard to handle bike. To get more money (and get a faster bike) the player must beat as many of the other 15 racers to the finish line, using all means possible, even kicking and punching them into knockout. By clearing (finishing on the top three spots) all five races on a level, the player advances to the next, where opponents are faster and tougher, the police is more active and a longer race.

As for new gameplay elements in the final title in the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, bikes can also be improved by choosing cheaper upgrades (instead of simply buying new ones) such as tires (less skidding), engine (improves acceleration and top speed), suspension (allows better control while landing after jumps) and body (bike takes more hits before turning into smoking metal). Instead on relying on simple motorbike patrols, the police now has helicopters at their disposal (which try to land on the player) and patrol cars, which attempt to block the path of the bike, forcing it to stop or collide to get a bust. To make things easier (or harder), new weapons were added, some of which allow the carrier to stun an opponent for a few seconds, making him the perfect victim for an incoming vehicle. Also new, if the player finishes the race with a weapon, carries it to the next race.

Each track has it's own features: in the UK, cars drive left on a rainy day, in Australia and Kenya animals wander into the road, in Brazil bikers can get themselves a close-encounter with a car on a crossing, in Italy the hills allow a lot of air-time for light and speedy bikes, Germany, where the icy roads and sharp turns make a deadly combination and finally in Japan the race goes during the night under the neon lights.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat III</name>
		<desc>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.

A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</desc>

		<name>Rolling Thunder 3</name>
		<desc>The events in the third game in the series are synchronous with RT2. At the end of the twentieth century, satellites around the globe are being shot down, disrupting communications. Secret agency Rolling Thunder discovers the organization behind the terror: Geldra. While agents Leila and Albatross are fighting the leader Gimdo (RT2), agent Jay is instructed to bring down Dread, the second-in-command.

There are many improvements to the gameplay: Jay can shoot while jumping and shoot diagonally upwards with certain weapons. At the beginning of each mission, you can pick a special weapon such as a laser rifle, bazooka, flamethrower or grenades. You have to choose carefully as they cannot be reused in later missions. You can still hide in doorways and recharge your weapons behind special doors. The mission timer from the previous game has been replaced by a sniper that targets you with a crosshair when you don't move fast enough. The brutal difficulty from the previous games has been toned down: there are more life marks at the start and you now resurrect where you died, rather than returning to the last checkpoint. Unlike the previous game, you can only choose one character to play with.

After completing a mission, a password is provided to continue playing. There are ten levels in total, with a few hidden areas.</desc>

Standard features of these types of pinball simulations include an animated backglass display, multiple bonuses including a multi-ball, extra ball, etc., and background music that changes based on active specials.

There are three main tables:

1. The Abyss (Aquatic theme)
Trick or Treat (Horror theme)
Wild West (Western theme)

An additional gimmick is a fourth Psycho Pinball table (circus theme) that has bonuses that can launch you to the other three tables, leading to massively high scores (and very long gameplay times).</desc>

		<name>Marvel Land</name>
		<desc>In the land of Coni, its inhabitants lived in harmony. At its center lies a mountain called "Peace", in which an amusement park known as "Marvel Land" resides. This park is well-protected by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became rule of the under dwellers and sent his minions to take over Marvel Land, imprisoning the Fairies inside crystal balls.

A young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue Wondra the princess, and free the Fairies from King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds with seven stages each, and the game plays in platform style, in which you need to run through the level, killing enemies, and find the exit door. More often than not, you have to go through a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at its center, you are awarded more points than you do by hitting it above or below.

You kill enemies by either jumping on their heads or attacking them with clones, which trail your movement unless you use them to attack enemies or collect food. The clones have a limited life and disappear one by one as you use them. 

During the game, you can open any treasure chests that you may find along the way, and release power-ups which include boots that make you increase your speed, dragon wings that enable you to jump higher and giving you the ability to glide to a soft landing, and giving you the use of the "clone" attack. Hidden throughout the sections are warp doors that can either take your backwards or forwards, anywhere within the park. Each section of a world has you riding a roller coaster, in which you must stay on the cars while avoiding signs and enemies.

The last section of each world has Talmit going through the castle to reach the end-of-world boss. Unlike other platform games where you must defeat bosses with weapons, you are challenged to various mini-games starting from "rock, paper, scissors" through to the Musical Chairs variant. If you win one of the mini-games, you are able to free one of the Fairies, and obtain a crystal ball that you need to defeat King Mole. You then proceed to the Bonus Stage where you must collect shooting stars for points. If you lose a mini-game, you are transported back to the start of the last section.</desc>

In Typhon's temple, Artemis gets locked in a dungeon where Medusa turns her into stone.

Phelios consists of seven chapters, and in each, you must defeat Typhon's minions using your sword which can emit fireballs at them. However, holding the fire button down for a few seconds will charge the sword; and upon releasing it, it shoots a larger fireball that does a fair amount of damage. During the game, you collect items that increases your speed and give you more firepower.

At the end of each chapter, you have to destroy a boss in order to proceed to the next one. Between each chapter, you can watch an intermission that details what is happening at the temple.</desc>

		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

		<desc>Genki's first game is a paddle/pong game with a background story. Once upon a time there were a prince and a princess who loved each other. But the evil jealous demon named "Y" turn them both into stone paddles. Suddenly, a blue sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now push forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons.

"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

		<path>./General Chaos (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>General Chaos</name>
		<desc>General Chaos is an arcade-style squad RTS where the player controls a team of five soldiers in a limited battleground, in a classic Red (General Havoc, headquarters in Viceria) vs Blue (General Chaos, in Moronica) all out war. The goal of the game is to push the frontline to the enemy headquarters, by winning individual battles and then beat them in their own capital.

There are five kinds of soldiers, each with their weapon of choice and range of attack: the Gunner (machine gun, medium range and wide arc), Launcher (rocket launcher, long range), Chucker (grenades that can be thrown over barricades), Scorcher (flame-thrower, close combat) and Blaster (dynamite sticks, close range). Before each battle, players can choose the composition of their team from one out of four choices: Assault team, Brute Force, Commandos (a team of just two soldiers which have different controls) and Demolition.

Gameplay is simple to learn, with the A button being used to fire at the nearest enemy, B to move to a the pointer location and C to cycle through soldiers. Using the commando team changes the controls, with the directional pad controlling a soldier directly, with B being used to call the other soldier nearby. While basic commands are simple, the player must deal with things such as distance from target and angle of attack to succeed.
If two opposing soldiers face-off during battle, they engage in a brawl (indicated by a cloud of dust). When that happens, the battle stops and the players are in direct control of the soldiers: A punches, B kicks and C blocks. Every downed soldier can can be rescued if there are enough medics available, earned at the end of each battle depending on how well the player did. 

Up to four players can play, cooperatively or against each other.</desc>

Take control of a Resistance fighter in this scrolling shoot 'em up consisting of nine platform-based levels, each ending with a Boss to defeat. Your enemies appear on foot and in vehicles, and Crimson has also planted machine gun bays en route. 

Dead enemies release keys, which can be traded in at shop points for weapons. These weapons include machine guns and flamethrowers, for which ammunition must be bought - weapons are discarded when you have no suitable ammo. The control system is unusual - you can shoot in different directions and crawl along low ledges.</desc>

		<desc>One windy day, there was an explosion at a nuclear power station, causing heavy doses of radiation to be poured over many people. One of these people was a young scientist named Chelnov. When he survived the deadly accident, he was possessed with abnormal powers. Having realized this, he decided to act in the cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</desc>

		<desc>Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess' castle and her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams.

Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.

Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.</desc>

Rick has married Jennifer and they have a son, David. In the final chapter of this horror trilogy, Rick finds out that an entity called The Evil One has kidnapped his beloved family members. He has no choice but to wear the demon mask with the supernatural powers to save Jennifer and David from the demon-infested Splatterhouse.

The third title in the series builds upon the gameplay of its predecessors. The game consists of six consecutive levels in a huge mansion. In a race against time, you have to wipe the demons from each room and find the quickest path to the boss area. After clearing a room, you can use an in-game map to decide upon the quickest route. Improvements over the second title include moving between rooms in multiple directions, multiple endings based on your performance, special moves for Rick and crisper graphics.

It still has a horror theme and maintains the same level of gore and violence. You can collect weapons such as a skull-smashing baseball bat, an ax and cement blocks. If you get knocked down, a ghost will try to snatch your weapon and drop it in another room of the house. Other collectible items include extra lives, health meat or orbs. These orbs build up a power meter. Upon completion, you have the ability to transform into a berserk mutant for a short time. The cutscenes feature real actors who act out the characters.</desc>

		<name>Wonder Boy III : Monster Lair</name>
		<desc>Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.

In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. 

In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.

If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.</desc>

		<name>The Killing Game Show</name>
		<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
   You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
   Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
   Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
   This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
   A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
   You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

		<name>Gain Ground</name>
		<desc>Gain Ground is an arcade style action game with a bit of strategy thrown in. The goal is get all of the soldiers to the opposite side of the screen or to kill all of the enemies. Each soldier in the army has a unique specialization, from among 20 types. Each soldier can attack in two different ways, using either a normal weapon or a special weapon. The strategy comes from deciding which soldier would do best in which situation. Some weapons are better at dealing with certain enemies and obstacles than other weapons.

Players start with only three soldiers but can encounter other soldiers that can be rescued, by touching them. If the new solider survives long enough to reach the exit, they can be added to the soldier inventory. The number of possible soldier in a player's army is over 30 soldiers. There are 50 stages total, divided into rounds of 10. At the end of each round, players encounter an enemy boss.</desc>

Unlike most other platform games of its time, Garfield boasted completely unique art on each of its six levels, both for tile art and character costumes. The levels are inspired by classic movies, but given a Garfield twist, like "Catsablanca" and "The Curse of Cleofartra.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Set after the events of the first movie, Sega's "Ghostbusters" follows the further adventures of Peter, Ray and Egon, as the make their way through six cases in an attempt to piece together a mysterious stone tablet.

Completely different than the Activision title of the same name, the Genesis "Ghostbusters" is a side-scrolling platformer that has the boys in gray running through houses, apartments, a burning house and a high-rise for starters as they battle a myriad of ghosts with their proton blasters.  When the Ghostbusters face off against a boss ghost, they have the ability to trap them the traditional way.

Peter, Ray and Egon, each have different abilities, and can purchase weapon and life upgrades from shops throughout the levels.  Other familiar faces make an appearance, as Slimer offers power-ups, and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man returns to settle the score from the movie.  

Solve the mystery of the tablet, and the Ghostbusters have to face off against Jenna, the Goddess of Death and Destruction.  Can the boys save New York one more time?</desc>

		<name>Herzog Zwei</name>
		<desc>The premise is that two opposing forces are in combat with one another. Each player controls a jet airplane which zooms across the screen and may turn into a ground based soldier. These ground soldiers can hurt enemy units, but can not affect bases. To take over bases scattered across the map (and ultimately, the enemy base), players must purchase new units and transport them to certain positions. In this way, the player acts more like a transport and management for different types of units rather than a combat character themselves. If the plane is ever destroyed, it restarts at the player's base location. As previously mentioned, a level is complete when either side's base is lost to the opposing forces.</desc>

		<name>Mutant League Football</name>
		<desc>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It's a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol' smash-mouth kind, literally.

Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it's all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him 'til he's dead. Suspect the ref's been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it's a 5 yard penalty though. 

Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.

There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</desc>

The Gleylancer comes equipped with two hovering satellites that can receive weapon upgrades of their own, and can lock their positions at specific angles to increase your firepower and protect the player from enemy attacks.

Unfortunately, Earl wasn't paying enough attention to where he was driving, and ran the ship into an asteroid.  The ship crash landed onto the most bizarre planet in the galaxy: Earth.

Toejam and Earl must travel from level to level on Earth and collect the 10 scattered pieces of the ship. But the various Earthlings, such as Nerd Herds, Giant Hamsters, Phantom Ice Cream Trucks and the Bogeyman will make that difficult.

The power up items that TJ and E can pick up come in the form of wrapped presents. You never really know what a power up is until you open it. What's more, randomized levels and item locations make it a different game every time.

The game features a dynamic screen splitting - screen joining 2-player mode.
Players start the game close to each other. If one gets away from the other, the screen vertically splits to allow each player to move freely. When players are close again, the screens join together to become one single screen.</desc>

		<name>Shining Force II</name>
		<desc>Shining Force II is a strategy/RPG hybrid with cartoon-like graphics. The game is comprised of two modes: exploration, in which the hero and his companions engage in the role-playing game standard of talking to townspeople, exploring new lands, and furthering the plot; and battle mode, in which the combat is resolved from a tactical point of view, with individual combats being resolved from a close-up view with animated characters.

The plot consists of such quests as saving a princess from the clutches of demons, rebuilding the hero's hometown, and uniting the various forces of good together against the hero's nemesis. Along the way, the hero will be joined by many characters who seek to aid him in his journey. Several of these characters can only be obtained by completing side quests. In addition, random battles can occur between the programmed scenarios, giving the hero's party a chance to obtain experience and gain levels outside of the set scenarios.

There are several difficulty levels in the game, selectable when starting a new game. In addition, there is a configuration code that allows cheats to be activated, including the ability to control the enemy units.</desc>

You are sent to the town Green Row to help your king's brother, King Weeden, to discover what has caused the mysterious disappearance of his town people. You must enter and explore huge dungeons in order to find out about an ancient story that has happened many years ago, and to face evil forces who threaten the land.

Light Crusader is an isometric action/puzzle adventure with RPG elements, along the lines of Landstalker.

		<desc>Welcome to 2050, chummer.

Shadowrun is an action RPG of epic proportions. You take on the role of Joshua, a Shadowrunner out to discover who murdered his brother. 

Along the way you get into street brawls, deadly gunfights, run the Matrix, slip into and out of the MegaCorps, explore the wild wilderness and deal with every low-life mage and high-tech cyber Street Samurai in Seattle.

Shadowrun was based on the FASA RPG of the same name, and while real-time, modeled every rule from the paper system, from character stats to experience to combat to weapons and equipment.

The game used an overhead view for physical combat, and a third person "POV" when on Matrix runs. It allowed two other characters to join your party either temporarily or "for life" however long that may be...</desc>

Chuck's weird features come in handy when, one day, this evil guy named Max D. Cap emerges from the underworld.  Max quickly takes over our world, and only Chuck can stop him.

The gameplay in Decapattack is of the side-scrolling platformer variety.  You play through several colorful worlds, collect useful power up potions, and deliver a beat down to the ugly bosses.</desc>

Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra- high- tech- indestructible- super- space- cyber- suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. 

Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place.

Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit.

Gameplay is similar to the first game, with Jim jumping and running through the levels. There are 5 weapons more than the original game to collect. Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and Psy-Crow appear.</desc>

		<desc>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another.</desc>

		<name>Rings of Power</name>
		<desc>For a long time, our world was in darkness. The sun shone as always, but our souls were dark and lacked the true enlightenment. Then the holy Nexus arrived, and changed everything. With his Rod of Creation, he blessed the people with the gift of the six Arts. The Red Priests - the people he chose among the others - established an order of the six Guilds. The world entered the era of prosperity. But the evil demon Void stole the Rod of Creation and drove the world to chaos again. In a cosmic battle, Nexus faced Void. None was victorious, and the Rod of Power was broken during the battle. It was divided into eleven rings, known as the Rings of Power. The young sorcerer Buc is now sent on a quest to retrieve those rings, and to unite the Rod of Power that will eventually banish Void forever!

"Rings of Power" is quite different from traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise, and is more similar to Western-style games such as  Ultima series. You can freely wander through the huge isometric world, and are not obliged to follow any storyline except the main quest for the eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs about many topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. There is a day/night cycle which affects the behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there are no weapons and armor in this game. The turn-based combat is entirely dependent on magic spells. On your journey you will encounter characters from several guilds, each proficient in his own type of magic, and make them join your party.</desc>

Rick has a basic set of punches, kicks and flying kicks, but he can pick up additional weapons such as a lead pipes, bones, bombs, a shotgun and a chainsaw for the ultimate bloodfest, while fighting skulls, razor fish and giant demons.

		<name>Streets of Rage 3</name>
		<desc>Streets of Rage 3 takes the series to the next level – faster, more complex, and more brutal than ever. With longer stages, branching storylines, and interactive environments featuring deadly traps, the game packs serious variety. New dash and dodge moves add speed, weapons break after use, and can now be integrated into combos. Team attacks return, and enemies use them too, showing smarter behavior – some even steal your health pickups! Blitz moves are now upgradeable but reset on death, though holding a button allows access at a cost. Special attacks no longer drain health but use a regenerating bar. Secret characters await those who meet hidden conditions. It's an intense street brawler with serious depth.</desc>

		<desc>Late one night, the malevolent Thump enters the Gadget Kingdom's castle and steals the Gadget King's gem. The king wakes up the next morning to find that his gem was stolen. The king then summons Bop and Bump to reclaim his stolen possession from Thump.

Gameplay consists of flying through six air and water levels: Gadget Bay, Zeppelin Attack, The Lost City, Sub Attack, The Crystal Lake and Thump's World. Although the game continually scrolls throughout its stages, the player can fly in all directions on the screen. Bop and Bump come equipped with a spring glove mechanism that lets the player punch either up, down, right or left, which is used to defeat enemies.

Defeated enemies drop coins. There are also chests littered throughout the stages which contain coins also. These coins can be spent at a shop where the player can purchase upgrades.

The game also contains bonus stages where the objective is to open all the chests in a limited amount of time.</desc>

Players control Granada across nine stages, using a map to locate and eliminate targets before facing a boss. The machine is equipped with a standard cannon, a powerful recoil blaster, and assist pickups that redirect shots toward enemies. A key feature is the fixed-cannon mode, allowing players to lock their firing direction while moving freely. The game includes three difficulty levels.</desc>

With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<name>Battle Mania Daiginjou</name>
		<desc>The Trouble Shooters, Mania Otorii and Maria Haneda, are a pair of bounty hunters who will take any job that involves lots of trouble and plenty of shooting. Their last job saw them saving the Crown Prince Denka from the evil military mastermind Don Morguestein, presumably ending his evil plans. However, three days later, Morguestein has returned once more to take revenge upon the Trouble Shooters. Mania and Maria, never wanting to miss out on the action, head off to take care of him once and for all.

Battle Mania Daiginjo is a comical anime-themed scrolling shooter, and the sequel to Trouble Shooter. The player controls the Dirty Pair-esque Mania and Maria simultaneously, with Maria following closely behind Mania, and also able to turn around and fire to the rear. Unlike most shooters, Mania has a health meter which can be replenished via pickups. There are a variety of weapons to choose from at the start of each stage, and during the game, weapons can be powered up. There is also a screen-clearing bomb attack, but it must be allowed to charge back up each time it is used.

The game includes a standard single-player mode with three difficulty settings. There is also a score attack mode which challenges the player to earn the most points possible in two minutes on a set stage.</desc>

		<path>./Ranger X (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Ranger X</name>
		<desc>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.

The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.

The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</desc>

Flying orange pods release many power-ups at once, enhancing the ships with new or more powerful lasers, wing men and shields. The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies. With an unforgiving difficulty, every hit is fatal, but the game can be continued from any points as long as there are lives and credits left.

		<desc>The people on a technically advanced planet Mota make experiments to create biomechanical creatures. But one day, a creature was created that appeared to be dangerous to the humans themselves. No signal came to the capital city from the experimental labs... You, a nameless young man living in Paleo, Mota's capital, are commanded to go to the labs and check the issue. Your friend Nei, a semi-human girl, goes with you, and other brave adventurers join you on what starts with a simple mission but develops into saving the entire world...

This is the first Phantasy Star game for the Genesis, set in a futuristic world. The turn-based combat allows you to choose between "fight", where the characters simply attack physically for one turn, and "strategy", where you can choose from several sub-commands, to defend, to use a special technique, or to run from the battle. Instead of magic there are "techniques", that require the usage of TP (technique points).</desc>

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.</desc>

		<name>Phantasy Star IV</name>
		<desc>The Algo star system is in troubled times...

Many thousands of years ago, the Algo Star System was a peaceful system. Three planets surrounded the peaceful Algo star and were in perfect harmony: Palma, a lush green planet, where its citizens devoted their lives to arts and the sciences. Motavia, a desert planet, inhabited by humans and native Motavians, and the enigmatic Dezolis, a harsh ice planet, where the citizens were just as unknown as the planet itself. Unfortunately, the harmony and balance was not to last. Palma had exploded, and with it, 90% of the population of Algo died. Motavia had fallen into horrible conditions from the explosion, turning almost into a total wasteland. The Darkness spread its hand over the land...

Now, 1,000 years had passed. Motavia had healed somewhat, and life was beginning to return to the way it once was thousands of years ago. The Hunter's Guild on Motavia helped to keep things steady. But now, a dark evil once thought to be long dead is beginning to stir once again, and the young Hunter, Chaz, is about to begin his ultimate adventure - and all of it started with one simple routine assignment...

The gameplay of the fourth entry in the  Phantasy Star is similar to that of the  second installment, sharing notable features such as the ability to equip two weapons at once, different healing items for humans and androids, most of the "techniques" (equivalent to magic spells in comparable games), etc. As before, leveling up and technique-learning is automatic. There are a few segments in the game with vehicle combat, which mostly follows the same turn-based formula as the regular battles. Side quests are present in form of hunter assignments for Chaz and his friends.</desc>

		<name>Mega Bomberman</name>
		<desc>Mega Bomberman is a top down strategy game. Control your Bomberman through various levels defeating multiple enemies and plenty of bosses. Each level consist of blocks for exploding and some blocks that don't explode. At times you will need the non-exploding blocks as shelter. The blocks that do explode reveal power-ups and eggs. 

The eggs are the unique twist to this version of Bomberman. When you get a egg, it hatches into a kangaroo. There are multiple kangaroo types, each with their own unique ability. You hop on the back of the kangaroo and utilize it's ability. If you happen to walk into an explosion the kangaroo takes the damage and dies and you continue to live. 

Another unique feature in multiplayer is you can choose your character. Pick one of 9 such as Miner, Tiny, Fat, Cop, Punk(On cover), Lady, Old man, Robot and the original Bomberman.

After selecting your character get ready for battle as you are placed in 1 of the 4 corners of the arena. Now just blow your way through the blocks and attack some opponents. Watch out for their bombs and remember to dodge your own. There are also many arena's to choose from. Each arena has it's own twist such as trap doors, an igloo to hide in, conveyor belts and more.</desc>

		<name>Wonder Boy in Monster World</name>
		<desc>"Monster World was once a peaceful region. Then, the peace was shattered by an invading army of monsters. A young man named Shion vowed to defeat them and make his land peaceful again."

Wonder Boy In Monster World puts you in control of Shion in his quest to save Monster World from the evil hands of BioMeka.  It controls like your standard platform game - run, jump, and kill enemies.  The game is filled with RPG elements such as talking to townsfolk, collecting money to buy items, upgrading your life, and equipping a variety of armor and weapons - staying very close to the "Zelda format".  You can save your game to continue your quest at a later time.

Wonder Boy In Monster World is the third game in the Monster World spin-off series.  In Japan the game is called Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3.</desc>

		<path>./Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water (Japan) (Translated).zip</path>
		<name>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia</name>
		<desc>This is one of the several games based on the animé series The Secret of Blue Water. The series (and the game) are loosely based on the stories by the famous French science fiction author Jules Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great inventions and technology progress unseen before. You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after her - this pendant is just the item she needs to build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and the power of science will eventually defeat Gargoyle!

Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective game, in which you actually move your character around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in the game, different characters have their own item-based abilities you should use at certain points). There are no real puzzles in the game, but you'll often have to use your inventory items to make the game progress.

Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!</desc>

		<path>./Red Zone (USA, Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Red Zone</name>
		<desc>Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator.  Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.

The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea.  Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series.  Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.

Interspersed with the plentiful in-chopper combat, there are numerous mission-oriented sequences in which the occupants of the helicopter disembark and perform missions on-foot inside of buildings.  Each of the three characters have a unique set of weapons, and the player can choose from either of the three to use, so long as none of them have been killed during previous on-foot missions.

Red Zone bears many gameplay similarities to the early entries of the Strike series of games, though while the first three games of that series had a fixed isometric point-of-view, Red Zone has a straight-down POV that rotates along with the helicopter.  Red Zone is also highly reminiscent of Zyrinx's earlier and similarly technologically advanced Genesis game Sub-Terrania, with the most notable similarities being in the relative difficulty of the games, and in the manipulation of the Genesis' hardware into providing visual effects not seen in other games, such as simulated video.</desc>

But his wife's father is murdered by a local gangster named Big Boy Caprice, and Dick Tracy is now out for revenge. The game doesn't follow the exact plot of the movie, but simply lets Dick Tracy fight his way through several levels until he faces his archenemy.

This is a platform shooter/"beat-'em-up" game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can't approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</desc>

Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite "Raiden". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship "Septemius 1" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, "Racoon", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. You are Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship "Septemius 2" that was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.</desc>

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.</desc>

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.</desc>

		<name>RoboCop versus The Terminator</name>
		<desc>The Dark Horse comic book crossover of the two famous 80s cyborgs spawned various different game adaptations. RoboCop versus The Terminator on the Genesis is only loosely based on the comic.

The player controls RoboCop who during his duty of policing the streets of Detroit is lured into a trap by Terminators sent from the future. By uploading himself into the computer network, he becomes the seed from which the malevolent Skynet grows. Years later, in the post-apocalyptic future, RoboCop is reactivated and must help the human resistance by attacking and defeating Skynet once and for all.

The game is a platformer with heavy shooting elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies stand in RoboCop's way and must be destroyed via 8 different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried at the same time and being killed means the currently equipped gun is lost.

The game is evenly split between present and future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include mostly street punks and other criminal elements while the future is of course populated by deadly machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders and many automated guns. Each level ends with a boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks and RoboCop's famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain (aka RoboCop 2).

Some levels feature optional goals besides getting to the exit, like freeing hostages or destroying security cameras.</desc>

		<desc>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...

Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</desc>

		<desc>Warsong is the only title of a series of famous strategy games, known as Langrisser in Japan, to ever see an official release outside of Japan. It is set in a typical medieval fantasy setting and features traditional turn-based combat. The player controls several generals who can command up to eight different units ranging from ordinary soldiers and archers to more exotic creatures like mermen or lizards.The generals fight alongside their units, however they are much more powerful and are able to use more diverse commands than just moving and attacking, like recovering a small amount of HP or casting spells. Each unit has certain strengths and weaknesses; for example soldiers are good against archers but weak against cavalry etc. Combat is also influenced heavily by terrain types. When two units engage in combat a small animation, similar to those seen in Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, is shown.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the award-winning TV series, The Adventures of Batman and Robin pits the player against the diabolical Mr. Freeze who wants to free Gotham with a huge ice cannon and his hired help of other Gotham super villains: The Joker, Mad Hatter, and Two-Face. The player can take the role of either Batman or Robin but this choice doesn't make a difference regarding gameplay. 

This is a side-scrolling action game. The player basically walks from left to right while fighting numerous foes in hand-to-hand combat. Weapons which are found during the levels are used to shoot enemies from a greater distance. These weapons can also be upgraded by picking up the corresponding symbols. 

There are overall four areas (one for each villain) with three levels each, including a film studio or the Gotham University. While most stages are typical fighting levels with occasional 3D effects there are also a few flying ones where the player uses the Batwing or a jet pack.</desc>

		<path>./Greatest Heavyweights (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Greatest Heavyweights</name>
		<desc>Greatest Heavyweights is a boxing game featuring the ex heavyweight champions Evander Holyfield, Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali, Floyd Patterson, Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey. Their likeness and real fighting style are simulated by the game.

The game is an enhanced version of Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing, being also played in a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. This time, a 2.5D camera is shown at the top of the screen.

There are three game modes:

1. Exhibition: one or two players can fight a single match.

2. Tournament: one player chooses among the eight heavyweight champs available in a eight-man tournament against the remaining seven.

3. Career: one player creates a character who starts as the #30 of the ranking, fighting his way up against fictional characters. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's color of skin (which now includes some unnatural colors such as green and blue), trunks and hair, haircut, size of body and stats emphasis (power, speed and stamina). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats. After reaching the #1 in the ranking, the player will be challenged by each one of the eight greatest heavyweight champions.

During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks, fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their sides.

Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their opponents. Each one of the heavyweight champions has his own set of personal taunts. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching each other on a regular basis.

The game plays sensibly faster than Evander Holyfield's, and the character animation is more detailed. There's a replay feature included, and the fights are announced by Michael Buffer's voice.</desc>

		<name>Dune : The Battle for Arrakis</name>
		<desc>Westwood Studios' real-time strategy classic Dune II received a major overhaul when ported to the Sega Genesis. While the basic concept remains the same, the game features all-new graphics, streamlined controls, changes to the tech tree as well as completely new levels.

As in the original game, the player controls the troops of one of three noble Houses, called by the Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. A series of consecutive battles must be won by mining spice, constructing a base and building units to attack the enemy.

The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit, for example.

The tech tree has been simplified: Among other changes, concrete slabs are only available in the 4x4 size, there is only one type of vehicle factory and the advanced units do not require an IX research center anymore.

Finally, the progression of levels in the console version is strictly linear, as there is no choice of the next map to be played as in the original version.</desc>

You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical "jump and run" game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective. Many missions are timed.</desc>

The peace of the land has again been threatened, this time by 'Dark Guld', who was supposed to be imprisoned but apparently isn't. He has instead now got his hands on the Golden Axe, and is using it for his own nasty purposes, and with his minions is causing much chaos.

So once more, Ax-Battler, the fierce barbarian; Tyris-Flare, the fearless Amazon; Gilius Thunderhead, the ferocious dwarf; get up to deal with the oppression, with their might and magic, and recover the Golden Axe.

The hack and slash gameplay, in a medieval fantasy setting, is essentially the same to that of the previous game. Beat up opponents with melee attacks and collect scrolls to launch magical attacks. Moreover,  players can also ride dragons and other beasts and use their attack capabilities to their advantage.</desc>

		<name>Monster World IV</name>
		<desc>This is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. You control Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, Asha was standing on a cliff near her home village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice calling for help. She decided to leave the village and to embark on an adventure to discover the identity of this mysterious person.

Monster World 4 is essentially a platform game, with slight RPG/adventure elements (puzzles, treasure, equipment, etc.) Asha can jump, run, attack or defend (by pressing the "down" button). She can also use items and equip weapons and armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. Later in the game, she will also be able to use magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist and help her on her journey. The combat system is very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health and mana points are measured in little hearts, and the more you progress in the game, the more hit points you gain.

The game was released only in Japan. It is sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".</desc>

Raster, a high-level orbot who watches Earth through a planetwide computer network, is accidentally attached to a working nuclear missile by a lesser orbot and goes insane, becoming an evil dictator named Warhead.

Enter Vectorman, a humble robot in charge of cleaning up toxic sludge by simply discharging it into the sun. As he lands on Earth after his last trip, he finds chaos and confusion.

		<desc>Sketch Turner was a starving comic book artist, living with his pet rat Roadkill... that is until a lightning storm mysteriously brought his cartoon villain, Mortus, to life and imprisoned Sketch within the pages of his own comic book. Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...

Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you're inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.

The game progresses linear through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's progressing.</desc>

		<name>Shadow Dancer : The Secret of Shinobi</name>
		<desc>A.D. 1997, New York City

Having vanquished the evil crime empire, Neo Zeed, the ninja master Shinobi and his combat ninja skills were not heard from for some time. But a new threat arose, in a reptilian form that lived on vicious instinct alone. The colossal monster moved slowly and quietly, and its attack was relentless. The souls unfortunate enough to survive became hostages, and mass panic swept the streets.

It remained only for Shinobi to take action. His weapons were stealth and quickness of attack, his only allies facing overwhelming forces. Relying on Ninja weapons and magic, Shinobi fought on, assisted by his faithful dog.

Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi is similar to Shadow Dancer for home computers, and consists of five missions containing three stages each. However, there are a few differences between the two. For example, in this Sega Genesis/Mega Drive exclusive, the stages are different, and you rescue hostages rather than disarm bombs.  Each mission ends up with you fighting a boss, and when you defeat each (except the final one), you also participate in a bonus stage where you must shoot all ninja flying towards you.

Some of the enemies are also quite different. Some of the lizards, which appear in later missions,  leave a "lizard coin", which you can collect for bonus lives.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : Tournament Fighters</name>
		<desc>The game features the original 4 turtles from the previous games in the series, as well as other fighters.

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called "Cyber-Shredder" here).

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to rescue April and Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</desc>

		<name>Shining in the Darkness</name>
		<desc>This is a story-driven console-style RPG, and is the first in the three game Shining series for the Genesis (followed by Shining Force and Shining Force 2). The Kingdom of Thornwood has been invaded by Dark Sol's men, and it is your job to vanquish them. You will need the Arms of Light to do this.

The game is a first person RPG, with turn-based combat and cartoony graphics. The dialogue is displayed via dialog bubbles appearing above the characters speaking, although the protagonist never speaks. There are no sub-quests - the secrets in the game involve  the location and use of special metal for forging esoteric items. There are about 25 to 30 hours of gameplay to be found here, before the final battle and ending sequence.</desc>

		<name>Langrisser II</name>
		<desc>"Langrisser II" is a sequel to  Warsong (whose original title is Langrisser). The events of the game take place several years after those described in "Warsong". Gone is the benevolent kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the Rayguard Empire, led by Emperor Bernhart and his four generals. Recently, Bernhart ordered his army to attack the neighboring countries, obviously searching for something. This "something" might be none else but a legendary evil sword, that makes the one who wields undefeated. It is up to the noble knight Elwin and his friends to stop the Emperor!

"Langrisser II" is a strategy RPG. The army is divided into soldier units and generals, who fight alone and who are usually stronger than a whole unit. Before the scenario begins, you must hire soldiers, buy weapons and items, etc. During the battle, if you come into contact with an enemy unit, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can also cast healing spells on your units or offensive spells to hurt the enemy.

The major difference between "Langrisser II" and its "remake",  Der Langrisser for SNES, is the absence of branching storyline in Genesis release.</desc>

Each of the four Isla Sorna sites contains three missions. Once you have completed the three missions you unlock the boss mission. For a change in the game, the boss missions are 3D look-alike levels. Once the four sites are cleared you get two more final missions to complete the game.</desc>

		<name>Outlander</name>
		<desc>Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.

The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.

Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.</desc>

There are 23 bizarre hockey teams to choose from, with players consisting of zombies, skeletons, trolls, and robots.  The arenas are equally strange, with hidden bottomless pits, mines placed under the ice, spikes, and a "Demon Net" that functions as a goalie by chomping up and down and devouring the puck.
The game plays similar to normal hockey, except in this game your players can pick up chainsaws, maces, axes, etc. to use against the competition.  It's a bloody game, with opponents exploding into piles of goo (or circuits if they are a robot) when they become too injured.  The player can call special plays, like an exploding puck or jail break and attack the goalie.  The game also has fighting sequences if two players decide to get into a brawl.  
The game comes with multiplayer and a playoff series, full stats for your players and instant replays.</desc>

You meet other Funkotron inhabitants and interact with them, things like helping them find stuff or ringing their doorbell and running away! All these people will help you in getting the job done and preventing Funkotron from losing its funky-ness.</desc>

You have become a cyborg slave in a munitions factory for the Cydrek Federation, a twisted machine with a human brain, unable to comprehend your situation, clouded by cybernetic programming until one day your human side finally starts to break through.  You remember everything and realize that the Cydrek Federation is building an army to take on the G.U.A. and you must stop it. You must take on the entire Federation using your new cybernetic body and stop them from taking over the universe.

You can build up to 216 different combinations of cyborg body parts to rip, tear and burn your opponents in submission, even using the destroyed parts of your downed foes and putting them onto your body. You can also play in Arcade mode in which you take on wave after wave after wave of opponents until your cyborg is finally destroyed or even play co-op with a buddy.  The game features up to five levels from the plants surface, the Cydrek Command Center even a futuristic jungle.</desc>

		<name>Kid Chameleon</name>
		<desc>Kid Chameleon is a side-scrolling platform game in which the main character has entered a virtual reality game called "Wild Side" to free the other kids inside that have been captured (*cuckoo*). He can change his shape into various other forms (hence the "Chameleon"). This gives him special abilities which must be used to pass each of the game's 100+ stages.

An interesting point about Kid Chameleon is that the game has 100+ levels (most of which are very, very difficult) which must be played in sequence AND there is no save feature or password feature - which means completing this game would be a major feat of endurance (and patience).</desc>

Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his adventure, he's going to need all the help he can get.

As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls. Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs. It's also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.</desc>

		<name>Dahna : Megami Tanjou</name>
		<desc>Dahna: Megami Tanjo (Dahna: Birth of a Goddess) is a beat'em up with some RPG elements. The player controls Dahna as she scrolls horizontally or vertically through the levels. Dahna fights her enemies using a sword, and she can jump in two heights, duck and crawl. Dahna has also a magic meter, which has several colored levels. Different levels of her magic will produce different magical effects (as in Golden Axe). Her magic can be replenished by gathering magical orbs, dropped by enemy mages when killed. They will also drop health orbs as well.

She starts the game "riding" a giant, and in other portions of the game, she'll also ride other creatures, such as a horse and a griffin. When riding a creature, Dahna can't use her magic powers.

As she kills enemies and gather orbs, Dahna gains experience points, which grant her level upgrades. Leveling up affects only her health, as she gains more health points.</desc>

		<name>NBA Jam Tournament Edition</name>
		<desc>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.

Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.

The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:

1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.

Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.

"Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.

"Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.</desc>

Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds – such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.</desc>
