		<desc>The Confederation have been at war with the Kilrathi for the past 20 years, and you're just now joining the Vega campaign. You're a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You're posted to Tiger's Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet.  Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? 

Wing Commander is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. 

The 3D space combat have you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. 

When the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree have both winning and losing paths. 

Wing Commander featured a hybrid bitmap/3D graphics  engine that allowed even 286's to display detailed 3D graphics to an extent never before possible. With EMS available, it can display even more detailed graphics and in-cockpit animations.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of the Mystical Ninja</name>
		<desc>Goemon (Kid Ying) and Ebisu-Maru (Dr. Yang) are enjoying themselves at home, when they hear about strange spirits sighted at the temple and taking control of the other villagers. Concerned, that a new evil has appeared, the two set out to confront it at the temple. This is just the beginning of a new adventure that will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages, amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!

Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.

At the end of each village is an "action area" which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a scrolling screen.</desc>

		<name>Riddick Bowe Boxing</name>
		<desc>Riddick Bowe Boxing is another one of the many boxing games released at the time, but with subtle differences. The HUD contains damage and energy meters along with a miniature ring up the top of the screen, useful to see the player's position in the ring so as not to get backed into a corner real easily.

Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or even a career mode, where there are four preset fighters to choose from along with an option to create customers boxers. The career starts out at position #25 in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on "Big Daddy" himself, Riddick Bowe.

The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for the graphics style and the included fighters.</desc>

		<desc>The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</desc>

		<desc>This version is different from it's Genesis counterpart.  While the gameplay is similar (exploring levels to collect clues and solve the mystery), there are four different episodes for this version.  While visiting the Drabwell Ranch, ghost's interrupt the festivities and the gang must find out who is behind the hauntings and why.  Another adventure takes the gang to Deadman's Cove where a ghostly pirate has been scaring off tourists and it is up to Scooby and the Gang to bring it to a halt. The other two mysteries take place at a fun fair and a haunted mansion.

Players can use Scooby's unique sniffing ability to find clues. Scooby also consume Scooby Snacks to reduce the fright meter.  Additionally there are a series of mini-games that player can participate in such as "Wac-A-Monster" or "Make a Scooby Sandwich".  The graphics are faithfully recreated to resemble the long-running Hanna Barbara series.</desc>

		<name>Cacoma Knight in Bizyland</name>
		<desc>The people of Bizyland were hard-working and prosperous. However, Wagamama, the queen of Lasyland was jealous and used the power of her magic mirror. The spell that was cast would switch the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The only people left unaffected by the spell were those who were not hard-working: notably the king of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot who were playing that day. Using the king's magic chalk, they must travel over Lasyland and restore enough of a percentage of each area so as to break the spell over each region.

Cacoma Knight is a puzzle-painting game. Choosing one of the three characters, the player will begin each level only able to move around the edges. The player can start using the chalk to move away from the edges and draw a line over the darkened area and reach another edge. Once a section (always the smaller) is "chalked off" from the rest, it will be restored.</desc>

Kamek kidnapped one of the brothers, but the second, Mario, fell down on Yoshi's island, where Yoshis live. The Yoshis decided to carry baby Mario and to bring him to his parents. But Kamek has sent troops and hordes of monsters to stop the Yoshis and to kidnap Mario.

In the game, players control the differently colored Yoshis most of the time. Mario is a helpless baby unless a star that makes him invincible is collected. As a Yoshi, players can swallow enemies to make eggs; these eggs are used for attacking other enemies and activating switches. Yoshi can do a flutter jump to clear large gaps that a regular jump can't. Players can also pound the ground for attacks and also flipping certain switches. Additionally, Yoshis can transform into vehicles, such as a helicopter, submarine, or a train. If Mario is dismounted from a Yoshi, a countdown will start, and Yoshi must catch the baby before Kamek's servants kidnap it. When Mario is invincible, he doesn't ride on Yoshi and is immune to attack. While invincible, Mario can run up certain walls.</desc>

		<name>Super Mario RPG : Legend of the Seven Stars</name>
		<desc>Super Mario RPG is a console RPG starring none other than Nintendo's popular character Mario. This game starts off like almost every other Mario game, with Bowser kidnapping Princess Toadstool. However, when Mario goes to Bowser's Keep to save her, a giant sword made by the evil Smithy crashes into the castle and sends Mario, the Princess, and Bowser flying to separate parts of the world.

The game plays much like a traditional RPG: Mario and the members of his party gain experience points by defeating enemies. These experience points can increase the team's maximum number of hit points and flower points (magic points). The battles are also turn-based, but this time there are timed attacks and defenses. Timed attacks allow you to inflict more harm than normal to an enemy. Timed defenses, on the other hand, allow an enemy to inflict less harm than normal. You are only allowed to have three out of five team members on your party at a time. Mario is always in your party, regardless. Your team members can also purchase more weapons and abilities, along with better armor.</desc>

		<desc>S.W.A.T Kats is a game based on the short lived cartoon series S.W.A.T Kats: Radical Squadron. The series would only last for 2 seasons but built a sort of cult following afterwards.

The Swat Kats are a trio of mechanics by day, but secretly also a group of superheroes defending their home, MegaKat city, from creatures and evil villians. Swat Kats is essentially a side-scrolling action game. You start off using T-Bone and Razor and guide them through 5 different worlds of action packed excitement. Game levels are based on different episodes of the show. As you progress through the game you can increase your weapon levels and gain new weapons. Mode 7 graphics are featured in some parts of the game. A unique feature to the game is the ability to start on different levels.</desc>

		<name>SimCity</name>
		<desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</desc>

		<desc>In this sequel to Putty, the Wizard's peoples have invaded Putty land, and it's up to you to head to the Wizard city of Klud and free your many POWs. The gameplay has less of a puzzle element than the original, and is more of a standard platform game - to whatever extent a game in which you can become an all-conquering Terminator Putty, must face pups throwing grenades at you, and can use Uncle Ted to play a tune to distract enemies can be seen as a 'standard' example of anything.

You take control of the same amorphous blob as before, which has the ability to 'stretch' left and right (using this as a weapon which kills on contact) and to stretch upwards to make jumping easier. He can also explode himself and absorb other objects, even becoming them physically to gain an advantage.

There are stars littered around the level, and collecting these upgrades Putty's abilities, starting with a super punch for 10 stars, going up to the Terminator ability for 40. 

The pups from the previous game are no longer on your side, and are out to get you. These have all manner of abilities - shooting mortar bombs at you, paradropping towards you, and even flying a helicopter.</desc>

		<name>Super Adventure Island</name>
		<desc>You are a caveman named Master Higgins. You have a beautiful girlfriend, and you like spending time sunbathing together on high trees and other places on the tropic island Waku-Waku. But all of a sudden, an evil magician turns your wife into a stone! As you begin to realize what happened, a bird grasps you and throws down somewhere on the island. You have to find your way back and to save your girl from the grim reality of petrification...

This emotional drama turns out to be a rather simple platform game. The short, linear levels are all timed, so you have to hurry up and not to get delayed by the many treasures you might find on your way. You will have a weapon, your old trusty boomerang, which you will be able to upgrade during the game. After a series on levels, you will be invited to a boss battle. The sooner you complete a level, the more bonus points you get.</desc>

The main objective of each level is to clear the playing field of all the cookies. The player mixes and matches the cookies such that entire rows or columns consist only of cookies of the same type. The player controls a cursor on the grid that is used to rotate individual lines in a manner similar to a Rubik's Cube. When a single row or column contains all matching cookies, the row is cleared from the grid. The grid grows in size from cookies entering from the top and right sides of the playing field and a game over occurs when the grid overflows. A sixth cookie type, shaped like Yoshi's head, occasionally appears that acts as a wild card, used to help clear lines of any other cookie.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Quest V : Tenkuu no Hanayome</name>
		<desc>You are the son of the brave warrior, Lord Papas. It appears that your mother died just after giving birth to you, and your father took you on a long journey when you were a little baby, and all you know is that he was searching for something. Now you are six years old, and Lord Papas brings you to your home village. After some time, you learn that His Highness Prince Henry was kidnapped by bandits. Your father attempts to rescue him, and during this action you discover that perhaps your mother is still alive... The game follows the story of Papas' son, and this story is stretched over years, as the hero grows and becomes a man of courage and virtue. During the game, the hero will discover the truth about his mother, and will have to make some crucial decisions, such as which girl to marry (the decisions affect the course of the game and its ending).

"Dragon Quest V" is a party RPG with turn-based combat, and battles viewed from 1st person perspective, just like all its predecessors. Your party roams about the world, fighting random enemies, performing quests, and defeating bosses. The novelty is in the game's unusual story, which spans almost a lifetime of the hero. 

"Dragon Quest V" was not available outside of Japan until 2009, when the DS version was released in the United States.</desc>

He hopes to create new functions in nature that will remove the pollution from the Earth before it is too late. Unfortunately Dr. Bruford's experiments go wrong and genetic monsters are unleashed upon the world. The only thing that can stop these creatures are Dr. Bruford's previous achievement: Genetically enhanced warriors known as the Run Sabers. Two of the Run Sabers, Sheena and Allen are ready to activate.

Run Saber is a side-scrolling platform game similar in gameplay to Strider. Players assume the role of one or both of the Run Saber characters. Choosing either Sheena with her Ice powers or Allen with his Thunder powers, players must defeat mutant monsters. The Run Sabers can move side to side, jump in the air, attack with a sword, climb along walls or roofs, slide across the ground and drop-kick. Additionally, each character has a special move, which damages everything on the screen with either Ice or Lightning, and which can be activated by collecting orb power-ups. Other power-ups include small health, large health, extra life and a larger sword. Players progress through 5 different levels, often encountering powerful boss and miniboss mutant creatures.</desc>

In order to find Melody, Rocky Rodent has to complete a number of fast-paced, side-scrolling platformer levels. While he can also defeat enemies by jumping on them, his most important weapons are four different hairstyles: His first hairstyle allows him to skewer and throw his enemies, destroy porous blocks as well as cling to and jump up certain ledges. A mohawk can be thrown at enemies like a boomerang or thrown into certain walls, from where it serves as a trampoline. Braids can be used as a grappling hook and a corkscrew-like haircut lets him bounce on his head to jump higher than normal. When Rocky is attacked by an enemy, he looses his current haircut.

		<desc>One day a spaceship came down from the heavens and into the skies of Chinaland. It began broadcasting an image of peace. Soon Emperor Chin was holding a peace conference with the space ship's leader, Rub-A-Doc. Rub-A-Doc visited with some of the other places in the world before departing to the heavens and leaving the world. All seemed peaceful however there seems to be trouble starting up, strange monsters have been seen throughout Chinaland. Could the increase in monsters be somehow related to the recent visit from Rub-A-Doc? The ninja masters of Mount Edin, Jack and Ryu are sent to investigate...

Super Ninja Boy is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two player game, each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack appears.A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.

As mentioned, this game is an RPG and contains familiar RPG elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells... as well as activate various 'bonuses' on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.

When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack &amp; Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills accuired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.</desc>

Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful blows in whatever direction possible.

Monsters are forever regenerating but food for health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort to be killed...</desc>

		<desc>In Boxing Legends of the Ring, you step into the ring with eight middleweight legends — including Roberto Durán, Jake LaMotta, Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, and James Toney. You can fight in exhibition matches or rise through the ranks in career mode to become the greatest of all time. Use jabs, hooks, uppercuts, and even the occasional illegal low blow to wear down your opponent. Every knockdown earns you a Super Punch — a devastating strike that can end the fight if it connects but is lost if you miss. Two indicators track the action: glove-shaped hit meters and a damage display showing fighters' faces bruising and bleeding over time. A neat twist is that the camera alternates each round, switching between your view and your opponent's shoulder for a more cinematic experience.</desc>

		<name>Liberty or Death</name>
		<desc>STORY
The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).

GAMEPLAY
Choosing Sides
In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as the "rebels" - the American Continental Army or as the "Crown" - the British Royal Army.

Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading Commander-in-Chief:

The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George Washington.
The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.

Revolutionary Politics
Each turn you will have to balance your treasury for the war effort. Money is provided by each state. The more states that support your cause, the more money will flow in your coffers. Money is spent in paying wages, strengthening the fleet and recruiting new regiments.

Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also command your Navy officer to "control the seas" which is conducting a blockade and privateering against enemy ships. This may result in seized goods that will be added to your treasury. 

The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death included everyone except the American Indians: [1] Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not yet fully supportive of Continental Army (not under your full control) [2] Loyalist Militia: Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: The French will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army: The Spaniards will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held.

Revolutionary Combat
The Top-down turned based combat introduces units available in the Revolutionary War: Infantry, Guerrilla, Cavalry and Artillery (Engineers). Combat near shores may also be joined by Naval units: Fleet and Fires Ships.</desc>

		<name>Tiny Toon Adventures : Buster Busts Loose!</name>
		<desc>You play Buster Bunny, in a series of levels, featuring characters from the Tiny Toon Adventures cartoon.

Most of the six levels are platform levels, where Buster has a number of attacks to defeat the enemies he faces.  These include kicks and jumps, and a dash ability that lets you slide into enemies to defeat them, and also climb walls.

The fourth level is an exception, and consists of a game of (American) football, played with a simplified version of the rules.  The idea is simply to get a touchdown, while as usual progressing at least ten yards in four downs.  There are two plays: a running play, where you simply run as far as possible while avoiding the opposing team; and a passing play that starts with a pass that can gain you extra yards, but must be caught.

Between levels there are bonus games.  You spin a wheel to determine what game you play out of five available.</desc>

		<desc>The kingdom of Toaru prosperous and peaceful place that's famous for its magic.  Within Toaru castle lies the Magic Gem which legend says can give the person who holds it great magical powers.  Because of this, it is sealed inside the castle to prevent the gem from landing in the wrong hands. 

One night, a dark figure and his army of monsters invades the castle and steals the gem.  Armed with a sword and her magic powers, the Princess Toaru sets off to retrieve the gem and save the world.

Magical Pop'n let's you play a young, energetic little princess who is simply called...Princess.  The game starts off with Princess chasing after a floating bad guy off a balcony and into town. 

Princess has two type of weapons: her sword and  her magic powers. 

When using magic, Princess will consume star powers.  Different types of magic requires a different number of stars.  Stars can be collected throughout the game and you can also get stars after defeating a foe.  In the first stage you will only have access to Princess' magic beam powers which shoots small beams of laser at enemies.  Later, you will receive the ice, fire and other powers.

The sword can only be used to perform close range slashing against enemies. But it does not cost any stars.

In each stage, Princess will be confronted with a number of enemies that she must fight off to advance.  There are many mini-bosses and at the end of a stage, you will have to fight the main boss.

Princess' health is indicated by the number of hearts she has in her health meter.  There are various items that will help refill the meter: Candy refills half a heart, A slice of cake refills a whole heart and a birthday cake will refill the entire meter.

You will be taken to the game over screen if you lose all your lives.   But, no worries, there's an unlimited number of continues. There is no save feature in the game.</desc>

		<path>./Sparkster (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Sparkster</name>
		<desc>Sparkster is a 2D side-scrolling platformer starring the eponymous hero who previously appeared in Rocket Knight Adventures. It is very different from the contemporary Genesis title Sparkster, as it does not continue the story from the first game and has completely different levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics. In that way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. The introduction merely shows how an elderly man captures a girl and takes her into his airship. At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.

Sparkster is a rodent carrying a rocket pack on his back. He can move around, duck, jump and hang from branches or rails. His regular attack is a sword slash that sends out a circular projectile. Through the L and R buttons he can dash left and right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack button pressed powers up a rocket meter. When full, different types or actions can be performed: dashing left, right or up to cover a large distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal motion, or a stationary attack.

The game consists of nine levels of which the last two can only be accessed on higher difficulty levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, defeats all types of robot enemies and collects apples to restore his heart meter near the top of the screen. Most of the game consists of regular platforming gameplay, with a few diversions where Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a top-down view flying in the air like a vertically-scrolling shooter. All levels have a level boss along with a large number of mid-level bosses. The game supports a password system.</desc>

Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be?

		<name>Ganpuru : Gunman's Proof</name>
		<desc>The year is 1880. Two meteors fell on Earth on a small island near North American Pacific Coast. In the middle of the island there is a small town governed by a sheriff. At first, the town's inhabitants didn't pay attention to the meteors. But then, strange things started happening. Monsters attacked people, and left on the victims' bodies a mysterious crest with one word: demiseed. One day you, a young boy who lives in the town, are contacted by two aliens who came in a miniature space ship. One of the aliens introduces himself as Zero, the Space Sheriff, and explains that an intergalactic criminal named Demi has escaped from justice and is hiding somewhere on the island, being the cause of all the troubles lately. Zero then possesses your body, lends you his powers, and commands you on the quest to destroy Demi and to bring peace to your island and to the alien world alike!

The game is an action/adventure with slight RPG elements (buying and upgrading weapons, etc.) set in Wild West. While featuring traditional dungeon-crawling and many enemies to dispose of in real time combat, the game doesn't equip you with standard medieval swords, but with pistols, shotgun, machine gun, and even a flamethrower. Your weapons have infinite ammo. You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</desc>

		<path>./Gokujou Parodius (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Gokujou Parodius</name>
		<desc>Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade. The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different names and functions for their upgrades.

In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:

1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius

2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at least one Goemon

3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching glove

4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure

5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on top of a missile

6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head and on his underside

7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his head

8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more 'normal' characters

9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his appearance in Parodius

10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat

11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of  Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this crazy shooter

In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.</desc>

The trouble is there is mass chaos in the land and the only way Arthur can stop it is to find the holy grail which has been hidden for over a thousand years. Aurthur is joined by Percival and Lancelot on his quest to find the grail. 

The gameplay involves the player to scroll along the screen fighting of enemies with a sword or axe depending on the character. The player can also block and parry with opponents which is done by a simple button press. There are also character development elements in the game where collecting points by killing enemies and picking up gold increase the character's attack and speed.  Character's armour and weapons also change when they gain experience.</desc>

		<name>Front Mission Series : Gun Hazard</name>
		<desc>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.</desc>

		<desc>As the other games in the series Pop'n Twinbee is a vertically-scrolling arcade shooter in which you and a friend get behind the controls of Twinbee and Winbee, the cutest starfighters ever created, and try to clear stage after stage of enemies with your weapons. Being a console original instead of a port, Pop'n features a number of additions to the gameplay mechanics, including an energy bar, eight difficulty levels and a handicap feature when playing with a friend (which makes most enemies target one fighter instead of the other).

The upgrade system remains consistent with the series's: you shoot colored bells which give different power-ups when collected, including multiple shots, "options" and shield energy. Also when correctly powered-up both fighters can join and perform powerful team-up moves.</desc>

		<name>Magic Sword</name>
		<desc>As the hero, you must climb up a monster-ridden tower to defeat Drokkmar, master of the Blackorb. To do this, you must defeat his army that stands in your way with whatever weapon you are carrying. Health is decreased by coming into contact with various monsters, attacks, traps, and the passage of time. It is increased by finding food. Every certain amount of points, a "Food Fairy" appears and drops off food as well.

Throughout your journey, you can smash open chests to find treasure and artifacts. Some of these artifacts can be recovered that alter gameplay, such as providing more damage or increased magical power. Also throughout your journey, you can collect keys, which are used to free imprisoned allies, who not only help you defeat monsters, but also leave you an item that will help you on your quest. Only one person can join you at a time.

As you progress through the tower, you will be granted new magical weapons after each boss you defeat. The weapons are affected by a "magic bar" that charges over time. When this bar is fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by jumping and attacking, but doing this costs health.

There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.</desc>

		<name>FireStriker</name>
		<desc>A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth and water
competed for the Trialight, a weapon created by the Arch Mage Wylde that can only be used by a Firestriker. The kingdom of wind won and united the four kingdoms. Wylde however, was not satisfied with peace and conjured four monsters to overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom of wind remains and the player takes control over the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms and defeat the monsters.

Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES RPG, it is in fact an action game that has more in common with a pinball-game than with any other genre. The Trialight is a ball of fire that basically behaves like a pinball. The player controls the Firestriker who can freely walk across the screen and strike at the Trialight to control its movement. Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight. The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects) have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life. Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map. As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.

Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative mode as well as a duel-mode for up to four players.</desc>

Mega Man Soccer is an overhead view soccer game featuring characters from the Mega Man series. Players begin by selecting either Exhibition, Tournament, League or Capcom Championship modes. Depending on the mode, a team must be formed using either all of one type of robot, or a mixture of different types assigned to different positions on the field. In any case, each soccer team has 8 players on the field including the goalie. The goal of each team is to score on the net of the opposing team, earning points to win the game. The action follows the ball as it is tossed around the field from player to player. Once a player's team member has the ball they can choose to pass it to another teammate, shoot the ball straight ahead or perform a clearing kick (if the goalie). If the player does not have the ball, they are given control of the nearest player to the ball and can slide tackles or shoulder tackles to try to gain possession. Each type of robot has a special move that can be initiated.</desc>

Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech's experimental warriors.  To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  

Killer Instinct is a Rare developed fighting game published by Nintendo (and distributed in the arcades by Midway).

The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Will is a young boy whose father disappeared long time ago. Now Will lives in a small town with his grandparents. He possesses unusual abilities of pushing and pulling things without touching them. One day, he finds in his house a girl, who soon turns out to be the princess Kara. Kara's father, king Edward, wants her to marry a mysterious person called the Jackal. Kara asks Will to help her to escape the palace, and soon they both get involved in a string of mystery and conspiracies...

The game is somewhat similar to the famous Legend of Zelda games, also having a "save the princess" story, and employing real-time combat. Will can also use his special abilities to solve simple environmental puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>Inspector Gadget is on yet another mission against the evil Doctor Claw and his army of M.A.D. (Mean And Dirty) agents.  This time it's personal because Doctor Claw has captured Gadget's niece, Penny.  With the help of his trusty dog, Brain, and his suit full of special gadgets, Inspector Gadget must save Penny and defeat Doctor Claw and his minions!

Gadget will start in a haunted castle in England, and from there, he will travel to many places around the world while pursuing Doctor Claw. On the way, he will be confronted by Doctor Claw's agents, and the only way to get by them is to use his gadgets and items against them.

Gadget can attack his enemies by using his punch (up, left right) and kicks which he is already equipped with.  

Several items he picked up can be used as weapons: 

Bombs - throw at enemies

Red Propellers - to be used against aerial enemies 

Offensive Arrow - shoot at enemies 

Little Inspector Gadgets - little robots that will run at and damage enemies.

If Gadget gets hit, he will lose his overcoat, leaving him in his boxers! In this state, he will lose a life if he gets hit again.  To prevent this from happening, pick up an extra overcoat that he can change into.

Other items include: 

Hands - comes up from Gadget's hat and will grasp onto rings

Suction cups - shoot at walls and have Gadget climb up them

Hats - used as energy source for certain gadgets</desc>

		<path>./Final Fantasy II (USA) (Rev 1).zip</path>
		<name>Final Fantasy II</name>
		<desc>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.

The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.

The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</desc>

Journey to different countries to defeat other fighters, eventually leading up to a battle with evil man M.Bison. Besides the standard punches and kicks, each character can also execute special moves, such as energy projectiles or lightning-fast kicks, for more damage or to create a chain of hit combos. 

This home version is a re-release of the original Street Fighter 2 game with several major improvements: the 'boss' characters (Vega, Balrog, Sagat, and M. Bison) are automatically unlocked for you to play, each character receives some new or upgraded moves and costume colors, and you can select a Turbo speed level which lets you play at a faster speed. It is based on the arcade re-release by the same name which also contained the subtitle "Hyper Fighting."</desc>

		<desc>The fourth installment in the popular strategy series, set in the continent of Jugdral, southeast of Akaneia. The game's first fifth chapters follow the Prince of Chalphy, Sigurd -- from there, his son Celis becomes the protagonist. The game uses the same turn-based strategy gameplay as its predecessors, but changes up the promotion system by making it entirely level-based, adds RPG-style status effects, and introduces the concept of the weapons triangle, in that a sword is strong against an axe, spear against the sword, and axe against the spear. Seisen no Keifu also featured much larger maps than previous titles (though a lower number of them -- 12 in all) and a handful of new units, such as the Troubadour, Dragon Master, and Falcon Knight. The game was released late in the Super Famicom's lifecycle in Japan and never published internationally.</desc>

		<desc>Bassin's Black Bass is a fishing game endorsed by the professional fishing champion Hank Parker. It is another entry in Hot-B's long line of fishing games. Players aim to become a professional fisherman and can travel by themselves or along with Hank.

There are four different fishing areas players advance to as they win each round of the tournament. Players travel by boat on the water, select a fishing spot and then select lure and cast fish. Certain types of fish are only available at specific spots. There is also a fish radar that makes a sound when there is fish nearby. Players need to select the correct type of lure (there are about 20), keep track of weather conditions and the limited time available in tournaments. Some fish fight back hard and need to be reeled in with careful timing.

The four tournaments are Local Amateur Tournament, Amateur Bass Championship, Pro Bass Tournament and Bassin' World Championship. About eight types of fish can be caught.</desc>

Similar to it's predecessors, Super Turican features large levels that are crammed with secrets and can be explored freely and in any direction. To get rid of the numerous enemies, Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also a great help in discovering secret capsules. These capsules contain powerups and can often be used to reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican has the ability to transform into an energy wheel (as long as he has enough special energy), which enables him to lay mines and even makes him invincible.</desc>

Defeated enemies drop different kinds of items such as magic bags , food to replenish your health, money and keys that are used to open treasure chests in some of the bonus-games that take place in-between battles.

The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player's success.
The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.</desc>

		<name>Secret of Evermore</name>
		<desc>You start out as a nameless boy and his dog, literally from the town of Podunk.  You chase the dog into an old abandoned mansion, where a scientist lived 30 years ago.  Some of his equipment is still operational, and when your dog chews on it, you're both sent to the strange world of Evermore.  Now you must try to get back.
The action-RPG gameplay is very much like Secret of Mana, with a few key changes.  Multiplayer is out.  Rather than three characters, there are just the two.  The equivalent of magic is alchemy, where each effect requires several base ingredients which you gather as you go along.</desc>

		<desc>Terranigma tells the story of Ark, a boy growing up in a remote village cut off from the outside world by lava. When he opens a forbidden door and releases a strange creature from a box, he disrupts the balance between two worlds and turns all villagers into stone. To save them, Ark must seek out five towers, uncover the secrets of both worlds, and confront dark forces. The game combines fast-paced combat with weapons and techniques such as dash and leap attacks, with RPG elements where Ark grows stronger after each quest. With its high level of detail, mix of action and RPG, and a branching story shaped by the player's choices, Terranigma stands out as a truly unique adventure.</desc>

		<path>./Front Mission (Japan) (Translated).zip</path>
		<name>Front Mission</name>
		<desc>In the future, many military forces are dependent on huge mech robots, called Wanzers (Walking Panzers) for combat. At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the "Larcus Incident" and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. 

One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed "Carrion Crow". Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.

Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a seperate unit and, has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</desc>

Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.

The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flute’s aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, you’ll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments.</desc>

		<desc>Young Morris Rolph has been trapped in limbo due to a malfunction on Dr Krankenpot's new teleport machine (how come characters with German-sounding names in computer games and films are always evil or stupid? Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now he's been split into his 4 component parts, represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game's plot-line of improved technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.

The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't progress.</desc>

		<name>Top Gear 2</name>
		<desc>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. 

You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</desc>

		<desc>Thanks to an improved version of the SuperFX Chip, Stunt Race FX was the first racing game for the SNES to feature fully polygonal cars and levels, which made it possible for the game to include gradients and obstacles that could not be realized in earlier, "flat" racing games.

The game features four modes of play: 
Speed Trax is basically an arcade mode where the player has to qualify for each upcoming race by reaching checkpoints while collecting items to restore his damage- and boost-bar. It is divided into a Novice-, Expert-, and Master class, with each class featuring four unique tracks.
In Stunt Trax the player has to complete courses filled with obstacles within a certain time limit while trying to collect as many stars as possible.
Battle Trax is a two player mode taking place on special tracks without any CPU-controlled opponents.
Finally, Test Run let's the player practice all tracks that have been unlocked.</desc>

		<name>Super Castlevania IV</name>
		<desc>Simon Belmont returns in the first Castlevania title to grace the SNES.  The console may be different, but the setup is very familiar: The place is Transylvania.  The villain is Count Dracula.

Belmont has the classic Castlevania assortment of weapons (the famous whip, daggers, axes, fire bombs, boomerangs) at his disposal, and he gains strength and points by collecting various-sized hearts, coin purses, and pork chops. 

Like most Castlevania games, Super Castlevania IV is a 2D side-scrolling action game. However, it is 2D with more depth than ever before. Parallax scrolling and rotating chambers are some of the "Mode 7" effects made possible by the SNES hardware.</desc>

		<desc>Young Simba just can't wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</desc>

		<desc>The story of this game is based on Episode IV: A New Hope, the first of the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.

Most of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun , as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</desc>

		<path>./Bust-A-Move (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Bust-A-Move</name>
		<desc>Bust-A-Move (also known as Puzzle Bobble) is a real-time puzzle game in which the player controls a device called "pointer" at the bottom of the screen, aiming and releasing randomly colored bubbles upwards. Depending on the aiming, the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen.

If the ceiling of the area is covered by too many bubbles, it will gradually descend; the game is over when it nearly reaches the player-controlled pointer. Should the player fail to release the bubbles within a specific time limit, they will be released automatically, unaffected by the pointer's aiming.

A two-player mode is included as well. Each player competes on an area occupying half of the screen, dealing with identically generated bubbles. Whenever a player successfully disposes of a bubble group, a part of it is transferred onto the opponent's part of the screen.

The game features the two dinosaur protagonists (Bob and Bub) as well as other characters from Bubble Bobble, even though the two games have distinctly different gameplay.</desc>

		<name>The Lost Vikings</name>
		<desc>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</desc>

He will be thrusted into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.
Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs".
The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from Final Fantasy game. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques.There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely.
The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings.</desc>

		<desc>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</desc>

And not only this: it separated the ardent lovers again. After the winds stopped blowing, Tina found herself somewhere on a tropical coast. As for Master Higgins, he went to the king of Waku-Waku and, along with his main quest to save his brand new wife, got an assignment to save also a princess, whom the king was about to marry. Is there a connection between those two events?..

No, this is not a detective/mystery game, but platform arcade action. What distinguish the game clearly not only from ordinary platformers, but also from the first Super Adventure Island, are its light role-playing and puzzle-solving flavors. You don't have a time limit, but huge levels with many secret sub-levels to find, puzzles to solve, and treasure chests to unlock. You also can have equipment, such as swords, shields, etc. By defeating enemies, you gain health items, money, etc. Your HP is measured by hearts, and it can increase during the game if you find appropriate items. You also encounter random enemies while traveling on a world map.</desc>

		<desc>Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.
There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.</desc>

Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

		<name>Mickey's Ultimate Challenge</name>
		<desc>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.

Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.

After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</desc>

		<desc>Kirby's Dream Course is an innovative SNES game featuring everyone's favourite pink blob, Kirby. After his adventures in Dream Land we find him in this mini golf game where Kirby himself is the ball, and you must guide him around each hole using the sort of bar system that you see in most golf games. Where this game differs, however, is in the fact that you need to eliminate all on-screen enemies before you can guide Kirby into the hole and complete it. As per usual in golf games, the more strokes it takes you to complete the whole, the lower your score - so make sure you aim Kirby just right!

You'll find eight courses and a total of sixty-four holes in the game, not including the final showdown with King Dedede, as well as an action-packed two-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Utopia takes the Sim City gameplay concept and adds a military element to it. The game is set in the distant future, where your job is nothing less than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. 

You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. 

Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.</desc>

After an intense battle they enter the saloon where they dispose of every cowboy in sight while redecorating the interior. Our heroes flee the scene by climbing on the roof, but what's that sound? ... it's a HUGE robot!
Wild Guns is a shooter with a western &amp; Sci Fi theme. Gameplay is somewhat similar to the Time Crisis &amp; House of the Dead games, with the exception that the game isn't played from a first-person perspective but from a third-person perspective. You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming crosshair. Select either Clint or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming rockets.
After the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train . Finally there's a showdown with the big bad guy.</desc>

Blackthorne's father, the good King Vlaros, sent him to Earth just as his kingdom crumbled around him.  Now, 20 years later, Blackthorne is grown and must return to Tuul to free it from the clutches of Sarlac.

This game is played from a side-view with non-scrolling backgrounds. It has strong similarities to Prince of Persia, except you battle your foes using guns and bombs instead of a sword.</desc>

		<name>Batman Returns</name>
		<desc>The successful movie sequel Batman Returns spawned many different game adaptations. The SNES version presents the story of Batman's encounter with the Penguin and Catwoman as a side-scrolling beat'em'up, with one Batmobile driving sequence thrown in.

There are two varieties of the beat'em'up levels. One plays like Final Fight and similar games: Batman can move in two dimensions, beating up his enemies with various punches, kicks, combos and special moves.
Special gadgets to be used include the famous Batarang to take out enemies from a distance and "Test Tubes" filled with chemical explosives which will damage all enemies on the screen.

In the second type of side-scrolling level, Batman can only move in one dimension, left or right. The Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in these levels, Batman can use a grappling hook to cross dangerous areas unharmed.

Enemies in the beat'em'up levels usually belong to the Penguin's Red Triangle Circus Gang - clowns in all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on bikes, clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At the end of each level there is a boss fight, including several encounters with Catwoman and the Penguin.

In the Batmobile driving level, the action is viewed from behind. Batman has to evade clowns on bikes and shoot them down when he gets the chance. At the end of the road, another boss fight awaits.

Digitized images from the film illustrate the storyline.</desc>

		<path>./Super Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back (USA) (Rev 1).zip</path>
		<name>Super Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are omitted or changed. 

As in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game, mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter. 

The game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon completion of each of the game's 25 stages.</desc>

		<desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<desc>After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in NHL '94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in the series.

Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides). 

While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</desc>

		<desc>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool...

"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. What could that mean? The young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. This was the beginning of the demon summoner's story...

		<desc>In the first Secret Missions add-on to Wing Commander, the TCS Tiger's Claw responds to a distress call from the Terran colony in the Goddard System. Once they arrive, they find that the colony has been completely destroyed by a new Kilrathi secret weapon, with no survivors. The Tiger's Claw is then ordered to pursue the Kilrathi fleet into their own space and destroy this new weapon - without reinforcements or the ability to resupply...

The Secret Missions campaign adds 16 new missions to fly. Unlike the main game, there is no branching mission tree - progress is linear. There are also several new ships: a Confederation corvette, Kilrathi and Confederation freighters and of course the Kilrathi dreadnought with the secret weapon itself.

Characters from the main game can be transferred into the add-on, which also includes a "Mission Selector" to fly any of the missions from the original game.</desc>

		<name>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers : The Fighting Edition</name>
		<desc>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition is a game directly based on the world-known television series. In this game, you can choice among 8 playable characters: the Power Rangers' Zords (Thunder Megazord, Mega Tigerzord, Ninja Megazord, Shogun Megazord) or some of their known villains (Lipsyncher, Silver Horns, Goldar, Lord Zedd). The title offers 3 game modes: Story Mode (1-Player only), Fighting Mode (2-Player) and Trial Mode (a survival mode for 1-Player only).

During Story Mode, the goal is to defeat all the 4 Zords, the 4 villains up to Lord Zedd and last, but not least, Ivan Ooze. In this mode, you can opt by the Thunder Megazord (formed by the 5 original Rangers) or by the Mega Tigerzord (formed in conjunction with the White Ranger). The Fighting Mode is an traditional 2-Player head-to-head combat, where you can choose any of the 4 Zords or even the 4 villains. Trial Mode is a Endurance-like option, and the main goal is to win as many battles as possible using only 1 health bar (that will be partially replenished after each battle).

As well as many fighting games, you can take advantage of a Power Bar (here, it fills automatically): if you execute a Super Move when this bar is flashing, it will be cause more damage, besides increasing 1 level. Once you having reached its maximum status, it's possible to execute power-up versions of Special Moves or even unleash high-damage blows (Super Moves).</desc>

You can play as SSJ2 Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Perfect Cell, Cell Jr., Bojack or Zangya. Goku and Broli will be also available after you enter a secret code.

Some basic elements from Super Butouden have remained, such as the split screen system or the special attacks (which now are executed by a shorter button combination). However, now you will also count with the Meteo combos, which allow attacks with multiple hits. You can also hold down buttons in order to quickly recharge your energy. Special moves can be also fired back in retaliation to your rival's attack, marking then the beginning of a button smashing duel.

There are 3 game modes, including a story mode that lets you choose different paths and changes depending on the outcome of battles; a 1 vs 1 mode, where you can battle against another player or the CPU; and a martial arts tournament mode with an eliminatory system in which you and other players (or the CPU) choose a character to become the winner.</desc>

One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.</desc>

The upgrade system of Top Gear 2 gained new breath and now comes with newly designed parts: ranging from tires to engines up to atomic turbos! As players travel from one planet to another via spacecraft, they race on various planets in different systems, getting progressively harder. The prize money earned in each race increases as does the price of new car parts... Moreover, the game comes with a versus mode which allows up to 4 players to race simultaneously via splitscreen.</desc>

		<name>Shin Megami Tensei II</name>
		<desc>Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to the  first game. The events of this game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral, and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't last long. The Mesia faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new enclosed environment named Millenium. The Gaians rise up, but their rebellion is repressed by the Mesians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights. Some years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto discovers a man fighting for his life against a demon. He rescues the man, who doesn't even remember his own name, and trains him to fight in the arena so they might both go on to a better living in one of the upper-class areas of Millenium. And thus the new battle for a better future begins...

"Shin Megami Tensei II" features all the gameplay innovations of the previous game. You can summon demons, fuse them, make them battle for you, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and you explore the dungeons from a first-person perspective view.</desc>

		<path>./Dragon Ball Z - Super Saiya Densetsu (Japan) (Rev 1) (Translated).zip</path>
		<name>Dragon Ball Z : Super Saiya Densetsu</name>
		<desc>Cho Saiya Densetsu is based on the popular manga/animé series Dragon Ball. It follows the events described in the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, the second story block, which tells about the connection of the hero Son Goku with a powerful alien race, and new mighty foes from far away planets. The game starts just where the tale of Dragon Ball begins. Son Goku goes to meet his friends, but is stopped by a mysterious stranger named Raditz who tells Son Goku they are relatives. Raditz demands from him to destroy humanity, and as Son Goku refuses, takes his son Son Gohan hostage. To rescue his son, Son Goku joins forces with his arch-rival, the Demon King Piccolo, who obviously has his own plans concerning Raditz. And thus begins the story during which Son Goku will learn of his true origin...

The game is a RPG similar to the card-based Dragon Ball Z RPGs for NES. During battles, you choose cards from your card inventory, which determine the nature and the strength of your characters' attacks. You can also train your characters in training houses and upgrade their special Ki power. Unlike early DBZ RPGs, you can move around freely in Cho Saiya Densetsu, and your movements are not determined by cards. You can also fly around the world and use your special Dragon Radar to discover location of magical Dragon Balls.</desc>

They are even piloted by robots with one mission: to destroy. Military and intelligence officials of major countries have detected them, but they are afraid that they will be unable to prepare against an assault by this underground race. Their plan is to send you in to infiltrate their base and destroy them before they have a chance to unleash the war upon the rest of the world. You can choose to control either the Helicoptor or the Jeep, which have different advantages -- for instance, the Helicoptor is not obstructed by obstacles but the Jeep can fire in any direction. There are nine weapons (five permanent, four short-lasting specials) you can pick up along the way to help you destroy the enemy.</desc>

		<path>./On the Ball (USA).zip</path>
		<name>On the Ball</name>
		<desc>There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.

That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named "inertia."  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.

It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities, but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an arcade release of this game.

(Now if only someone could explain the "Camel" part - referencing the Japanese title.)</desc>

		<name>Sid Meier's Civilization</name>
		<desc>Sid Meier's Civilization is a turn-based  strategy game.  The game begins in 4000 BC. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a civilization, starting with only one settler unit and one warrior, and attempts to build an empire in competition with one to eleven other civilizations. The game requires a fair amount of micromanagement (although less than any of the simulation games). Along with the larger tasks of exploration, warfare and diplomacy, the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by barbarians, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. These threats only come from unclaimed land or sea, so that over time there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
		<desc>1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".

But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...

The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.</desc>

Gameplay consists of standard platform action spiced up with some slightly different (gameplay-wise) sequences.

		<name>Joe &amp; Mac 2 : Lost in the Tropics</name>
		<desc>This sequel puts you back into the roles of the cavemen, Joe and Mac. This time, a caveman named Gork has stolen the crown belonging to the Chief of Kali Village, and it's up to you to retrieve it by using the 7 Rainbow Stones you will collect on your journey.

Along the way, you will fight dinosaurs, cavemen, and other prehistoric enemies as your travel through the jungle, or through the ice and snow, or even through a volcanic wasteland. Along the way, you can pick up upgrades for your club, or pick up projectiles from eating certain health-recovery items. In some levels, you'll ride in a stone cart, trying to hope over gaps and avoid enemies as you try to reach the end.

Improving on the original's platformer/brawler co-op gameplay, this game adds adventure and role-playing game elements that create a more involving experience compared to the first game. You can now collect coins in the levels to purchase items from Tiki Village, such as meat to recover your health, or even remodel your hut back at your home village. The game also uses a password system to track your progress. The game also shifts to an overhead map so you can wander to whichever level you wish, and return to completed levels to earn more money or power-ups.</desc>

There is also a complete World Series, All-Star games and the MLB League. In the league modes up to eight players can choose a team and play a season of 26, 52 or 162 games. Between matches players can change the line-up and rotation, and trade away players.

Gameplay is fairly tradition, with fielding, pitching, batting and baserunning. Next to fastball and curveballs, there are six different pitches such as Super Fast, Screwball, Super Curve, Slider, Change Up and Knuckleball.</desc>

The player(s) begins with a set number of lives, a number which can be added to with good play. Run out, and your mission is over - there are no saves!

Before each level, the player chooses one special weapon that can be utilized via an often-refilled meter, in addition to their normal guns. But choose wisely, you can only use one special weapon per round, and once used, it will be unavailable to you in later rounds! Play solo or with a human wingman.</desc>

Shien's Revenge is a first-person Operation Wolf-style shooter that puts the player in the role of Shien the ninja. Movement is automatically controlled by the game, which scrolls horizontally or vertically. The player must use his weapons, long-range shuriken (throwing stars) and a close-range dagger in order to defeat various enemy ninjas and creatures that appear on the screen. A set of candles indicate the player's life meter. Power-ups such as rapid fire and scrolls can be picked up by defeating enemies. The use of scrolls produces a powerful attack that damages everything on the screen.

		<name>Total Carnage</name>
		<desc>The war of 1999 left the country of Kookistan in shambles. Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.

As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.</desc>

		<desc>The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang is an action-rpg starring the titular hero, a young vampire prince who must rescue his parents and save the inhabitants of the Vladamasco Islands from the evil Von Hesler. But is it really his handiwork, or is there someone else controlling him? Unravel the mystery while traveling to various locales, fighting Von Hesler's henchmen and picking up (CPU-controlled) companions along the way.

Spike McFang has three main methods of attack: by striking out with his cape, throwing his hat like a boomerang, or using a magic card. Cards can also heal his health or give his companions extra strength. Spike can also devour the still-beating hearts of his vanquished foes (or the dropped tomatoes of his vanquished foes if you're playing the sanitized North American version) to regain health. There are a total of four different hats that Spike can purchase as upgrades in his battle against animated garlic bulbs, bomb-throwing cats, head-spinning plants and a plethora of other dangerous enemies.</desc>

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</desc>

In each location you have a mission such as retrieve data or capture a terrorist.This usually involves searching around for your goal while dispatching enemies and trying to minimise civilian casualties. The emphasis is on action and weapons, in particular Arnold's favourites: flame thrower and the uzi. He also has a diving roll to help him dodge the enemies bullets and come back guns blazing..</desc>

		<name>Bonkers</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the Disney TV show of the same name. Bonkers is a bob-cat police officer who lives in "toondom", a cartoony land where people co-exist with various creatures from cartoon movies. 

One day, Bonkers and his partner Lucky hear about a shocking robbery: Hollywood's most valuable treasures - Sorcerer's Hat, Mermaid's Voice, and Magic Lamp - were stolen! Now it is up to Bonkers to capture the thieves and to take back the stolen treasures.

This is an action platform game. Bonkers can jump and dash, throwing enemies aside and even destroying some obstacles. Enemies can be killed by jumping on their heads. You can also collect various items such as bombs to throw at the enemies, cakes to refill your health, or hyper juice to make you dash continuously.

Besides the common license, this game is totally different from the Genesis game  Bonkers.</desc>

To aid him in his quest, Mario must use the flying ability of the feather to get him to places hard to reach. But what's even more important is his new friend, the dinosaur Yoshi, who Mario can ride through each level and eat the enemies.

Over 90 levels are on offer, with plenty of Bowser's evil koopas and new characters around each level. Apart from saving Peach, you can also save some of Yoshi's friends, other dinosaurs that each have a special attack. Each level also contains a set of extra items to collect, including dinosaur coins, and break the tape at the end of each level to collect stars, that allow you to open up the bonus games.</desc>

		<desc>Super Turrican is back, and once again the USS Freedom Forces have to prevent the evil Machine from harming innocent civilizations.
This requires the player to jump and shoot his way through large levels filled with lots of enemies. To get rid of all the enemies, several different weapons can be used, most of which are already familiar to players from previous episodes: a Laser, a Spread-shot, and a(improved) Rebound. There is also the option to go into "wheel-mode" for a limited time to become invincible, lay mines and shoot rockets. The Flamethrower is new to the series as well as the Rope, which can be used to climb walls, cling to platforms or pick up out-of-reach items. Much like in side-scrolling shooters, you can now pick up homing missiles as secondary weapons. The biggest difference to previous Turrican-games however, is the fact that in Super Turrican 2 almost half of the levels are strictly linear and don't feature any large secret areas.</desc>

The story of this version of Ultima VII is essentially the same as in the original PC version. However, the dialogues have been greatly reduced and/or simplified. This applies also to the size of the game's cities and other locations, the amount of items to pick up, interior details, etc.

Combat also underwent significant changes. The battles in this version are action-based; the player has to click on the enemy repeatedly to win. Unlike the PC version with its party management, the Avatar is traveling and fighting solo in this release.</desc>

Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.

You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</desc>

		<name>Metal Marines</name>
		<desc>The Antimatter Cold War has left Earth ruined as the stockpiled AM weapons of various nations were triggered in a chain effect, vaporizing large portions of the Earth. The once great continents have been drastically changed into thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans.  During this turmoil,  Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.

Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost.  The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs.  At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.</desc>

		<desc>A platformer title starring Valkyrie's lizard friend Xandra. In the game, which plays as a prequel of the Valkyrie games, you control Xandra as he leaves his enchanted forest in order to get help for his family. This will eventually lead him to meet up with our beloved Valkyrie and mark the beginning of their adventures.

Xandra has all the abilities of a standard platformer character, which allow him to jump around and navigate the many obstacles found in the game. Additionally he's armed with a pitchfork which he can use to impale his enemies and stick to some surfaces. Collecting coins allow him to purchase extra lives, but there are no added weapons or spells as in the Valkyrie games.</desc>

		<desc>Thracia 776 continues the Fire Emblem story with a midquel or a "meanwhile" setting. The events transpire during  Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu and the game contains many of the same characters from that game, while featuring cameos of many more. 

At its most simple the story is of Prince Leaf of Lenster's struggle to free his native land from two forces, the Grandbell Empire and the Loptus religion.

Features introduced into this part of the series include fog of war and night maps with limited vision, this requires characters to use torches and wands to light their way. Also the capture command which allowed enemies to be subdued and their weapons taken.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Quest 6 - Maboroshi No Daichi</name>
		<desc>You and two of your friends decide to attack the Archenemy - the evil Mudo - in his castle. But as you reach his throne, he attacks you and send the three friends into three different places...

Was this just a dream? You have just fallen out of your bed dreaming! It's time to go to the village elder, to get a seemingly simple assignment - to sell some goods at a bazaar in the nearest town. But soon the hero will discover his dream was not so far away from reality...

"Dragon Quest VI" is the last SNES game of the Dragon Quest series (called "Dragon Warrior" in US). It is a party RPG with turn-based combat and battles viewed from 1st person perspective. Not much has changed since the NES days of Dragon Quest - gameplay style, setting, and even menu layout seem almost identical to those of the early classics. Like its immediate predecessor  Dragon Quest V, this game was never released outside Japan.</desc>

		<name>Tetris &amp; Dr. Mario</name>
		<desc>Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.

In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or "line" without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).

In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).

For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills. The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the highest score is the winner.</desc>

		<name>Lucky Luke</name>
		<desc>Based on the famous comics series about good cowboy Lucky Luke.

In the game you as Lucky Luke have to arrest four Dalton brothers – Averell, William, Jack, and Joe. On your mission you will progress from level to level shooting bad cowboys, jail-breakers, and bad Indians with your revolver; collecting bullets, dynamites, sheriff stars, and other useful items; running, jumping, ducking, and climbing. The locations vary from Forts, Towns, and Jails to Mines, Train, and Saloon with Ghosts. On every level you have to complete different submissions to progress – either to free a Bank Director, or to collect Three Nuggets for Miner to obtain a Nitroglycerine, or to build a Totem for Apaches, etc. At the end of some levels you confront the big boss, it is often the one of Daltons.

Different arcade sequences between levels allow you to chase the Dalton brothers or train riding your faithful horse Jolly; to run away from Tornado; and to ride on the raft. 

Bonus level arcade sequences represent your wrestling challenge with Jolly, bottles shooting, or revolver's barrel roulette.

To access the one of the three certain parts of the game you may enter password.

The game was made in French/English/German/Spanish.</desc>

		<desc>This game is loosely based off of the movie of the same name, where the player can take control of either the Yellow, Black, Pink, Blue, Red or White Ranger in a side-scrolling beat-em-up in an attempt to stop the evil Ivan Ooze who is trying to control the universe.

There are six different levels to play in each with their own standard obstacles and enemies, mid-level bosses and of course end bosses that range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze himself.  There are no weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left behind.

Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers.  Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter.  Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and jumping abilities.</desc>

To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a number of crystals (how many - it depends on the difficulty levels) within a time limit. A compass in the corner of the screen helps him by showing the direction where the nearest crystal is.</desc>

		<desc>Adol's long time friend, Dogi wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there.  Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil.

Ys III breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games and allows Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions.  As well as changing the battle system, the game is now side scrolling instead of the previous games top-down view. Adol also now has the ability to jump.  Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : Tournament Fighters</name>
		<desc>The game features the original 4 turtles from the previous games in the series, as well as other fighters.

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called "Cyber-Shredder" here).

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to rescue April and Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</desc>

		<name>Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems</name>
		<desc>Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems is a side-scrolling platformer/beat 'em up based on the Infinity Gauntlet storyline from the comics.  Adam Warlock calls on the heroes to recover the 6 Infinity Gems before they are used for evil.

You may choose ones of five heroes: Spider-Man, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Wolverine.  Each one has different stats and abilities.  (i.e. Spider-Man is agile. Hulk is strong, Iron Man can double-jump with his rocket boots, etc.)  Initially you can choose a training area in Avenger headquarters or four levels.  As you complete levels, most open up.  Each hero can be equipped with gems to boost their abilities in each section.  These must be obtained by finding them in the levels.

Gameplay is fairly similar to X-Men-Mutant Apocalypse.  Combat is all on a 2D plane.  Each hero has basic jumps and attacks and special moves that can be executed with button combinations like quarter-rolls.  Enemies include various villains from the Marvel Universe and evil doubles of various Marvel heroes.</desc>

In this game, Duck Dodgers sets out to stop Marvin the Martian from performing various notorious deeds, including destroying his beloved home-planet, Earth. There seems to be only one way to stop Marvin - and that's to destroy all five of his deadly machines!

Gameplay-wise, this is a standard platforming affair. However, you can also shoot at your enemies using an array of weapons, fly around with your jet-pack and defend enemy fire with your shield.</desc>

		<path>./Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius</name>
		<desc>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius!

There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.

This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:
Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons
2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.
3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles
4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon
5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...
6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.
7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.
8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.
9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger
10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead
11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.
12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.
13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful
14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.
15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.
16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.</desc>

		<name>The Flintstones : The Treasure of Sierra Madrock</name>
		<desc>The Great Poobah has retired and is looking for a successor. Since there are so many candidates, it is decided that the person who finds the Great Treasure of Sierra Madrock will become the new Great Poobah.
The player takes control over Fred and Barney who also participate in the treasure hunt in order to make Fred the New Great Poobah.

The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock is a side-scrolling platformer that includes several board game elements. On a world map, Fred and Barney  throw dices to determine how many fields they can move. 

There are different fields that hold different challenges.

Most fields require you to finish a side-scrolling platforming level. Fred and Barney can jump, club their enemies and climb trees or stone pillars. Holding down the jump button lets them hover in the air for a short moment. Throughout the levels, different power-ups and items can be found: clamps are used as money, apples replenish some health, 100 stars grant an extra life to Barney or Fred and an empty Heart frame increases their life bar.

On fields marked with a skull, a boss has to be defeated. 

Heart fields hold bonus games in which you have to collect as many items as possible within the time limit.

At amusement parks, several mini-games can be played to win items or extra lives. Mini-games include: Memory; Balls O' Fun", where you can win items by throwing a ball at them; a mini-game in which you have to stop monkeys from climbing down trees and stealing your items by hitting them with coconuts and others.

In Cafes you can buy food to replenish your health.

In stadiums you can participate in special challenges (3D cart races for example), in order to gain new abilities such as double jumps.

While stadiums, cafes and amusement parks can be revisited, all other levels only need to be finished once.

Fred and Barney are not the only characters that move about the playing field. You will also run into their wives Betty and Thelma as well as other characters that are also looking for the treasure. When Fred or Barney encounter their wives, they are dragged a few fields back. Other characters give them useful items if you can beat them at a challenge (usually a race).

Other notable features are a password system and a competitive 2-player mode.</desc>

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.</desc>

Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.  

Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Pocky &amp; Rocky brings back the cooperative shooter action to the SNES with enhanced gameplay mechanics. Princess Luna has been kidnapped by a gang of evil demons and its up to Shinto priestess Pocky and her raccoon buddy Rocky to rescue her.

As in the previous game, the gameplay involves taking control of either character to clear stage after stage of enemies in classic top-down shooter manner by blasting them with your magic cards or other collectable unique powers. New for the sequel is the ability to play with optional AI-controlled partners that add team-up special moves required to beat certain bosses as well as unique abilities that take the game in different directions (opening locks, or digging to get to the underworld sections of each stage for instance).</desc>

		<name>X-Men : Mutant Apocalypse</name>
		<desc>Because of a rise of anti-mutant activity in Genosha, Professor Xavier uses Cerebro to scan the island nation and discovers Apocalypse's presence there. Genosha's government is apparently using Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under control. However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to investigate.

X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight with elements of a platformer, that is, players have to fight various enemies and survive the occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, monsters or known Super-Villains.

Each character has unique abilities and special moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors Kick), and require similar button combinations.

While most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men. Progress is saved via password.</desc>

You still control a "Cloud Palace" across a zoomable map of the world, choosing your next area of battle. In addition, many of the sound effects from the original game make their reappearance, as well as some hidden RPG elements. 

Changes from the original ActRaiser include the elimination of the village-building mode, a move from a battery-save to password-save system, and a new musical score.</desc>

Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.</desc>

		<name>Live A Live</name>
		<desc>In "Live a Live", you control seven main characters and play through seven different stories set in seven different time periods: prehistoric age, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, a futuristic world with robots and weird machines, etc. Those stories appear to have no common points, yet after completing all of them, you'll see they are in fact connected - the worlds of all those characters are threatened by the same ultimate evil force.

The combat features many innovations compared to traditional console RPGs: your position on the battle field is important, and certain techniques can be used only from certain positions, and enemy attacks also affect only specific parts of the field. Out of the seven chapters, some have more battle-oriented gameplay, while others are more devoted to puzzle-solving and information-gathering.

The game is one of the least known Squaresoft products, and was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens, who together with him escapes from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.

Out of This World is an action adventure game, where the adventuring element is concealed behind what looks like a typical platform shooter. The gameplay is based mainly on physical and environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy requires a different strategy, and often there is only one way to solve the problem. Typically, enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun you find near the beginning of the game; the gun can be used to create a shield from behind which you can safely fire. 

The game is divided into levels, each one of which can be accessed by typing a code you learn after having completed the level. If you die (which is often) you restart the level anew. The game features vector graphics and animated cut scenes.</desc>

In more longer tracks, players will find a Pit Stop section, where they can enter to replenish the fuel meter (total or partially). The game has a split-screen display for 1 or 2 players. In 1-Player mode, you'll dispute the races against the computer, that has a slightly bigger speed than yours, helping to give a lot more of competitiveness. A password system was included, being possible to stop a current game and resume it later.

Through the game, players will find several obstacles scattered by the courses, like rows of iron plates or even lots of stones. In order to qualify for the next circuit, it's required to complete it at least in the 5th position, or else the game is over.</desc>

That is when a player dies they can still throw bombs in from the sidelines in an attempt to swap places with a player that is still alive.  Many new powerups were added in this game including the Kangaroo which in addition to giving a player and extra hit allowed them to have some extra ablity including jumping, laying rows of bombs, and high speed running.

		<desc>The game is actually a set of seven main games: Spring Breeze, Dynablade, Gourmet Race, The Great Cave Offensive are unlocked at first, and later Metaknight's Revenge, Milky Way Wishes and The Arena become available, as well as a couple of minor minigames.
These are all typical Kirby platformers, each one with its own set of levels and different gameplay. In most of them you can consume monsters and learn their special abilities, but in Milky Way Wishes abilities are instead collected in a manner similar to Metroid. Offensive Cave features levels with various obstacles, hidden treasures and some elementary lever-pulling kind of puzzle solving. Metaknight's Revenge is the only game on the cartridge with a (fairly strict) timer. The Arena is a "boss rush" mode, asking players to defeat every boss in the game with limited health refills and on one life.
Kirby Super Star is best known for its two-player cooperative play option, which has given it a reputation as a party game.</desc>

		<desc>Donkey Kong has been kong-napped by the nasty K.Rool and the Kremlings, and it is up to Diddy Kong and his girl-friend Dixie Kong to save him.

All the familiar enemies and helpful friends return, along with some new characters, including the wise Wrinkly Kong who will teach you some important lessons in gameplay. Again the emphasis is on banana collecting, where as every 100 bananas makes one extra life. Apart from beating K. Rool and rescuing Donkey Kong, there are extra missions that can be completed. Collect enough K. Rool Krem Coins to open up the routes to the Lost World, while every level has a hidden Hero Coin to collect.</desc>

		<name>Uniracers</name>
		<desc>What do you get if you cross Sonic the Hedgehog with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater?

It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.

The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...

Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.

Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.

Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them. Much the same could be said about Uniracers...</desc>

		<desc>Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting series.

New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.

The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</desc>

Raptor has unleashed an army of ruthless, mutating Morphs upon the city to enforce his brand of order. Only two special forces agents, Slash and Alix do not submit to Raptor's will. Raptor decides to hatch a plan to kidnap Alix, so Slash, and more importantly his magic X-Kaliber sword, will come to him in an attempt to try and rescue her.

The game consists of two modes. The first modes gameplay consists of side-scrolling action. The player can jump and swing a sword at enemies. The player can also deflect projectiles with the sword. The game also features one on one boss fights that are set up similar to a fighting game. The second mode is a two player duel that is set up like the one on one boss fights but is between two human controlled players.</desc>

Grant can only carry two weapons at a time. You hunt dinosaurs and explore the park, where frantic movements can make the dinosaurs more aggressive, while slower actions help you avoid attacks. As you traverse jungles, hills, and buildings, you collect useful items like batteries, ID cards, or night vision goggles to progress.

Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits

Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version)  in this conversion of a classic arcade game.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Quest I.II</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.

In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants. 

Both RPGs feature random battles and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. In Dragon Quest you fight alone, while in the sequel two other characters can join your party, and you also fight against multiple enemies at once.

The remake includes updated graphics (although they still retain the original NES look), sound of SNES quality, and some changes in the gameplay and in the game world. Certain locations are larger, some menu commands (such as "Stairs") are omitted, and there is a larger variety of items.</desc>

		<path>./Wild Snake (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Wild Snake</name>
		<desc>WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a  confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes.

The game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).

The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.

The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.</desc>

		<name>Ganbare Goemon Kirakira Douchuu : Boku ga Dancer ni Natta Wake</name>
		<desc>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.

The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.</desc>

After you choose your fighter for his parameters (strength, stamina and resistance), you can choose from 55 different moves.
You can now train your fighter at a gym before the real fights.
To master the game, one must alternate training and fights, as training improves stamina, strength and resistance.
Be careful, loosing a fight reduces those parameters, so you have to be ready before getting on the ring !</desc>

You play "The Master", and must save the world from evil. First you purge the land by sending your spirit into a warrior with a big sword and magic powers. This side scrolling portion puts you in many different locales, from swamps and forests, to pyramids and snowy mountaintops. As you eliminate evil from different parts of the land, you allow villagers to return and build their towns. You then control an angel who helps guide the villagers in their town building, and can send down miracles to aid them in their needs.</desc>
